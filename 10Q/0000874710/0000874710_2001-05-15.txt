ALLIED HEALTHCARE PRODUCTS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)

1.     Unaudited Financial Statements

       The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with the instructions for Form 10-Q and do not include all of the
information and disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles
for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all
adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments considered
necessary for a fair presentation, have been included. Operating results for any
quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any other quarter or
for the full year. These statements should be read in conjunction with the
financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements thereto
included in the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2000.

       Certain amounts in the fiscal 2000 financial statements have been
reclassified to conform with the fiscal 2001 presentation.

2.     Inventories

       Inventories are comprised as follows:

                        ===========        ===========
</TABLE>

       The above amounts are net of a reserve for obsolete and excess inventory
of approximately $2.8 million at March 31, 2001 and $2.9 million at June 30,
2000.

3.     Oxygen Regulator Recall

       On February 4, 1999, Allied announced a voluntary recall program for
aluminum oxygen regulators marketed under its Life Support Products label. These
products are used to regulate pressure of bottled oxygen for administration to
patients under emergency situations. Based upon U. S. Food and Drug
Administration ("FDA") recommendations that all manufacturers cease the use of
aluminum in oxygen regulators, the Company introduced new brass regulators and
also offered a trade-in program to existing users pursuant to which units with
aluminum regulators could be exchanged for new units with brass regulators at a
reduced price. In connection with this program, the Company recorded a charge of
$1.5 million pre-tax in the


                                       6

<PAGE>   7


second quarter of fiscal 1999.

An additional $.2 million pre-tax charge was added to the recall program in the
first nine months of fiscal 2000.

       A reconciliation of activity with respect to the Company's regulator
program for the nine months ended March 31, 2001 is as follows:

<TABLE>

                                                                      ========
</TABLE>


4.     Commitments and Contingencies

       The Company is subject to various investigations, claims and legal
proceedings covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course
of its business activities. In fiscal 2000, the FDA conducted an inspection of
the Company's St. Louis facility and provided a written report citing FDA
observations concerning Good Manufacturing Practices ("GMP") compliance and
quality control issues. The Company has provided written responses to the FDA
and is taking corrective action to mitigate any further FDA inquiry or action.
The Company believes that its responses to date and its continuing attention to
the matters raised by the FDA will avert any FDA action seeking to interrupt or
suspend manufacturing, or to require any recall or modification of products.
Based upon currently available information, the Company does not believe that
the FDA investigation will have a material adverse impact on the Company's
consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

       The Company has incurred various legal expenses related to third-party
claims associated with the LSP oxygen regulators. During fiscal 2000 the Company
recorded a $0.5 million pre-tax charge to operations for amounts estimated to be
payable by the company under its self-insurance retention for legal costs
associated with defending these claims. The company recorded an additional
$50,000 pre-tax charge to operations during fiscal 2001. These amounts are
included along with other legal expenses of the Company as selling, general and
administrative expenses. At March 31, 2001, the Company has a litigation cost
accrual balance of $0.13 million for legal expense associated with the LSP
regulator matters.

       The Company has recognized the costs and associated liabilities only for
those investigations, claims and legal proceedings for which, in its view, it is
probable that liabilities have been incurred and the related amounts are
estimable. Based upon information currently available, management believes that
existing accrued liabilities are adequate in light of applicable liability
insurance maintained by the Company and that the Company's possible additional
exposure under retention provisions relating to pending claims or occurrences
would not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results
of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.


The following discussion may contain statements that constitute "forward-looking
statements" as that term is used in the Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995. Such forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties as further
discussed in the Company's 2000 Annual Report filed on Form 10-K. Actual results
in future periods could differ significantly from results discussed in or
anticipated by such forward looking statements. This discussion should be read
in conjunction with the June 30, 2000 consolidated financial statements and
accompanying notes thereto included in the Company's Form 10-K for the year
ended June 30, 2000 and the unaudited financial statements and notes for the
three month and nine month periods ended March 31, 2001.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Allied manufactures and markets medical gas equipment, respiratory care
products, and emergency medical products.

THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2001 COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2000.

Allied had net sales of $16.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2001,
down $0.4 million, or 2.8%, from net sales of $16.7 million in the prior year
same quarter. The decline is primarily due to lower sales of respiratory
disposables and lower construction product sales due to economic conditions. The
declines were partially offset by higher sales in the third quarter of this year
of medical gas equipment and emergency equipment.

Gross profit for the three months ended March 31, 2001 was $4.4 million, or
27.0% of net sales compared to $4.6 million, or 27.7% of net sales for the three
months ended March 31, 2000. The decrease in gross profit for the third quarter
of fiscal 2001 as a percent of sales is primarily attributable to lower sales
volumes and lower product prices on a spot basis to maintain share in market
conditions prevailing in the March 2001 quarter.

Selling, General and Administrative expenses for the three months ended March
31, 2001 were $3.8 million, unchanged from $3.8 million for the three months
ended March, 31, 2000.

Income from operations was $0.6 million for the three months ended March 31,
2001 compared to $0.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2000.
Interest expense was $0.4 million in both comparable periods. Allied had $0.2
million income before income taxes in the third quarter of fiscal 2001 compared
to $0.5 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2000. The Company recorded a tax
provision of $0.16 million and $0.28 million for the three month periods ended
March 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

In fiscal 2001, net income for the third quarter was $40,000, or $0.01 per basic
and diluted share compared to $0.21 million or $0.03 per basic and diluted
share, for the third quarter of fiscal 2000.


                                       9

<PAGE>   10

NINE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2001 COMPARED TO NINE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2000.

Allied had net sales of $47.2 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2001,
down $2.4 million, or 4.8%, from net sales of $49.6 million in the prior year
first nine months. The decline was primarily due to lower sales of oxygen
regulators this year due to an exchange program last year which increased sales
beyond normal levels and due to lower construction market sales as a result of a
decline in hospital construction. Also, sales were adversely affected by a
strike by production workers at the Company's St. Louis plant in the first
quarter of fiscal 2001 and subsequent delays in returning to adequate production
and shipment levels. Although the strike was settled on July 30, 2000 with a new
three year contract, the Company had difficulty returning to normal production
levels until the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2001.

Gross profit for the nine months ended March 31, 2001 was $12.6 million, or
26.6% of net sales compared to $13.3 million, or 26.8% of net sales for the nine
months ended March 31, 2000. The primary reasons for the lower gross profit were
expenses which did not decrease with lower sales in the nine months ended March
31, 2001 and product mix. The Company will continue to review operations to
improve productivity and lower manufacturing and product costs.

Selling, General and Administrative expenses for the nine months ended March 31,
2001 were $11.6 million, a decrease of $1.1 million, or 8.7%, from $12.7 million
for the nine months ended March 31, 2000. The decrease was primarily due to cost
reduction efforts that were initiated in the second quarter of last year,
primarily a 15% staff reduction. Also, product liability litigation expenses of
$50,000 and $0.4 million were included in the nine months ended March 31, 2001
and 2000 respectively.

In the first nine months of fiscal 2000, the Company recorded a $0.2 million
additional charge for expenses related to the LSP oxygen regulators program.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

We believe that available resources and anticipated cash flows from operations
are sufficient to meet our operating requirements in the coming year.

Working capital increased to $21.2 million at March 31, 2001 compared to $20.3
million at June 30, 2000. The increase was primarily due to an increase in
accounts receivable and inventories offset by increases other current
liabilities and accounts payable.

The Company maintains a $25 million revolving credit facility. At March 31,
2001, $8.3 million was outstanding against this facility and $5.2 million was
available to borrow based on collateral requirements. In fiscal 2001, the
Company has reduced long-term debt by $.9 million.

Inflation has not had a material effect on the Company's business or results of
operations.

LITIGATION AND CONTINGENCIES

The Company becomes, from time to time, a party to personal injury litigation
arising out of incidents involving the use of its products. More specifically,
there have been a number of lawsuits filed against the Company alleging that its
aluminum oxygen pressure regulator, marketed under its Life Support Products
label, has caused fires that have led to personal injury. The Company intends to
defend these claims in cooperation with its insurers. The Company maintains
aggregate product liability coverage of approximately $32 million under general
and umbrella policies. Such coverage is subject to varying retentions based upon
the nature of the claim. The Company believes that any potential judgments
resulting from these claims over its self-insured retention will be covered by
the Company's product liability insurance.

Costs associated with product liability insurance increased significantly for
fiscal 2001 as a result of claims associated with the Company's aluminum oxygen
pressure regulator. While the Company believes that the successful completion of
its recall program relating to the regulators should lead to reduced costs in
future periods, the availability of such insurance coverage at a reasonable cost
may remain problematic and the absence of such insurance, or any portion
thereof, could have a material adverse effect upon the Company's results of
operations and financial position.

The Company is subject to various investigations, claims and legal proceedings
covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of its
business activities. In fiscal 2000, the FDA conducted an inspection of the
Company's St. Louis facility and provided a written report citing FDA
observations concerning Good Manufacturing Practices ("GMP") compliance and
quality control issues. The Company has provided written responses to the FDA
and is taking corrective action to mitigate any further FDA inquiry or action.
The Company believes that its responses to date and its continuing attention to
the matters raised by the FDA will avert any FDA action seeking to interrupt or
suspend manufacturing, or to require any recall or modification of products.
Based upon currently available information, the Company does not believe that
the FDA investigation will have a material adverse impact on the Company's
results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
