         Statements contained in this Report, which are not historical facts or
information, are "forward-looking statements." Words such as "believe,"
"expect," "intend," "will," "should," and other expressions that indicate future
events and trends identify such forward-looking statements. These
forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which could cause
the outcome and future results of operations, and financial condition to be
materially different than stated or anticipated based on the forward-looking
statements. Such risks and uncertainties include both general economic risks and
uncertainties, risks and uncertainties affecting the demand for and economic
factors affecting the delivery of health care services, and specific matters
which relate directly to the Company's operations and properties as discussed in
the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2005. The
Company cautions that any forward-looking statements contained in this report
reflects only the belief of the Company or its management at the time the

ultimately prove inaccurate or incomplete. The Company undertakes no obligation
to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after
the date on which the statement was made.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                   (UNAUDITED)

1.       Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements

         The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with the instructions for Form 10-Q and do not include
all of the information and disclosures required by accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America for complete financial
statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of
normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation, have
been included. Operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative
of the results for any other quarter or for the full year. These statements
should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and
notes to the consolidated financial statements thereto included in the Company's
Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2005.

2.       Significant Accounting Policies

         Stock Options

         On July 1, 2005 the company adopted the provisions of Financial
Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 123R, "Share-Based Payment (Statement
123R), using the modified prospective transition method. Statement 123R sets
accounting requirements for "share-based" compensation to employees, including
employee stock purchase plans, and requires companies to recognize in the
statement of operations the grant-date fair value of the stock options and other
equity-based compensation.

         The fair value of options granted is estimated on the date of grant
using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. For options granted during the
three months ended September 30, 2005, the assumptions utilized in the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model included an expected life of 10 years,
risk-free interest rate of 4.21%, volatility of 51% and no dividend yield. No
options were granted during the three months ended September 30, 2004.

         Share-based compensation expense included in the statement of
operations for the three months ended September 30, 2005 was approximately
$19,000. Unrecognized shared-based compensation cost related to unvested stock
options amounts to approximately $74,000.

         Prior to July 1, 2005, the Company accounted for employee stock options
in accordance with Accounting Principles Board No. (APB) 25, "Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees". Under APB 25, the Company applies the intrinsic
value method of accounting. The Company did not recognize compensation expense
at the grant date for options granted because the Company grants options at a
price equal to the market value at the time of grant.

123R:

         Short-term Investments

                  The Company classifies its short-term investments as trading
securities under the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 115 ("SFAS No. 115"), "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities". SFAS No. 115 considers trading securities as securities that are
bought with the intention of being sold in the near term for the general purpose
of realizing profits. The Company's short-term investments consist of auction
rate securities. Trading securities are recorded at fair market value.

3.       Inventories

                  In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, "Inventory
Costs." SFAS No. 151 requires the allocation of fixed production overhead costs
be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities and unallocated
overhead costs recognized as an expense in the period incurred. In addition,
other items such as abnormal freight, handling costs and wasted materials
require treatment as current period charges rather than a portion of the
inventory cost. SFAS No. 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred during
periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company treats wasted material,
abnormal freight and unallocated overhead cost as current period charges. The
adoption of SFAS No. 151 had no effect on the Company's results of operations,
financial position or cash flows.


Inventories are comprised as follows:

4.       Earnings per share

         Basic earnings per share are based on the weighted average number of
shares of all common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per
share are based on the sum of the weighted average number of shares of common
stock and common stock equivalents outstanding during the year. The number of
basic shares outstanding for the three months ended September 30, 2005 and 2004
was 7,829,577 and 7,818,432 respectively. The number of diluted shares
outstanding for the three months ended September 30, 2005 and 2004 was 8,061,758
and 8,065,741 respectively.

5.       Commitments and Contingencies

         The Company is subject to various investigations, claims and legal
proceedings covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course
of its business activities. The Company has recognized the costs and associated
liabilities only for those investigations, claims and legal proceedings for
which, in its view, it is probable that liabilities have been incurred and the
related amounts are estimable. Based upon information currently available,
management believes that existing accrued liabilities are sufficient and that it
is not reasonably possible at this time to believe that any additional
liabilities will result from the resolution of these matters that would have a
material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations,
financial position or cash flows.

6.       Financing

         On September 1, 2005, the Bank and the Company agreed to an amendment
of the credit facility. In conjunction with the amendment to the Company's
credit facility, the Bank extended the maturity on the Company's revolving
credit facility from April 24, 2007 to September 1, 2008. The entire credit
facility continues to accrue interest at the Bank's prime rate. The prime rate
was 6.75% on September 30, 2005. The interest rate on prime rate loans may
increase from prime to prime plus 0.75% if the ratio of the Company's funded
debt to EBITDA exceeds 2.5. The amended credit facility also provides the
Company with a rate of LIBOR plus 1.75%, at the Company's option. The optional
LIBOR rate may increase from LIBOR plus 1.75% to LIBOR plus 2.75% based on the
Company's fixed charge coverage ratio. The 90-day LIBOR rate was 4.07% at
September 30, 2005.

         At September 30, 2005 the Company had no aggregate indebtedness,
including capital lease obligations, short-term debt and long-term debt.

         The Company was in compliance with all of the financial covenants
associated with its credit facility at September 30, 2005.

7.       Stock Repurchase Arrangement

         On August 25, 2005, the Board of Directors authorized repurchases of
shares of the Company's common stock pursuant to open market transactions in
accordance with Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act or in privately
negotiated block transactions. The authorization permits repurchases from time
to time until June 30, 2007 at the discretion of the Chairman of the Board or
the President and Chief Executive Officer. The authorization permits up to $1.0
million to be applied to such repurchases. No specific number of shares are
sought in connection with the authorization. The Company received the consent of
the Bank for this authorized repurchase. As of September 30, 2005 no shares have
been repurchased under this arrangement.

         During the first quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company recorded a charge
to cost of sales of $600,000. This charge included $216,000 for severance
payments and fringe benefits for the 12 bargaining unit employees. The charge
included $200,000 for the value of Baralyme(R) inventory in stock and the time
of the withdrawal, and associated disposal cost. The charge also included
$184,000 for replacement of Baralyme(R) inventory which was returned by our
customers as a result of the withdrawal. The Company has replaced Baralyme(R)
returned by its customers with Carbolime(R), a carbon dioxide absorption product
which continues to be offered for sale by Allied.

         In addition to the provisions of the agreement relating to the
withdrawal of the Baralyme(R) product, Abbott has agreed to pay Allied up to
$2,150,000 in product development costs to pursue development of a new carbon
dioxide absorption product for use in connection with inhalation anesthetics
that does not contain potassium hydroxide and does not produce a significant
exothermic reaction with currently available inhalation agents. As of September
30, 2005 no amounts have been received, and $74,000 is receivable, as a result
of product development activities. This amount, $74,000, has been included in

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2005 COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER
30, 2004.

         Allied had net sales of $15.0 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2005, up $1.1 million, or 7.9%, from net sales of $13.9 million in
the prior year same quarter.

         Sales for the three months ended September 30, 2005 include $116,250
for the recognition into income of payments resulting from the agreement with
Abbott Laboratories to cease the production and distribution of Baralyme(R).
Sales for the three months ended September 30, 2005 also include $74,000 as a
result of product development activities to pursue development of a new carbon
dioxide absorption product. The agreement with Abbott provides for Abbott to pay
Allied up to $2,150,000 in product development cost to pursue development of a
new carbon dioxide absorption product for use in connection with inhalation
anesthetics that does not contain potassium hydroxide and does not produce a
significant exothermic reaction with currently available inhalation agents.

         The Company ceased the sale of Baralyme(R) on August 27th, 2004 upon
completion of the agreement with Abbott, and recognized one month of income,
$38,750, during the three months ended September 30, 2004. Income from the
agreement will continue to be recognized over eight years, the term of the
agreement, at $38,750 per month. Additionally, sales for the three months ended
September 30, 2004 included recognition as sales of a one-time $600,000 payment
from Abbott Laboratories for cost incurred in connection with the withdrawal of
Baralyme(R) from the market, the disposal of such product, and severance
payments payable to 12 manufacturing employees. Allied continues to sell
Carbolime(R), a carbon dioxide absorbent with a different formulation than
Baralyme(R).

         Domestic sales were up 4.7% from the prior year, while international
business, which represented 15.3% of first quarter sales, was up 26.5%. Orders
for the three months ended September 30, 2005 are up a modest 1.95% over orders
for the same period of the prior year. However, purchase order releases were
$1.6 million higher than in the prior first quarter, leading directly to the
7.9% increase in sales in the first quarter. Purchase order release lead times
depend on the scheduling practices of the individual customers.

         Gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2005 was $4.0
million, or 26.7% of net sales, compared to $3.4 million, or 24.4% of net sales,
for the three months ended September 30, 2004. Cost of sales for the three
months ended September 30, 2004 includes $0.6 million in cost incurred in
connection with the withdrawal of Baralyme(R). The improvement in gross margins
from the prior year period is primarily attributable to higher absorption rates
for fixed cost due to the higher sales and production in fiscal 2006. The
Company is continuing its active efforts to further reduce the cost to produce
its products.

         Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended
September 30, 2005 were $3.2 million, a net increase of $0.3 million, or 10.3%,
from $2.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2004. This increase
includes an approximately $40,000 increase in commissions as a result of higher
sales. Business travel is approximately $0.1 million higher than the prior year.
Travel expenses are primarily related to the Company's sales efforts. The
increase also includes an approximately $0.1 million increase in salaries and
wages as a result of scheduled increases. There have not been changes in
staffing levels over the prior year.

         Income from operations was $0.8 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2005 compared to $0.5 million for the three months ended September
30, 2004. Interest income was $7,957 for the three months ended September 30,
2005 compared to interest expense of $73,846 for the three months ended
September 30, 2004. Allied had income before provision for income taxes in the
first quarter of fiscal 2006 of $0.8 million, compared to income before
provision for income taxes in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 of $0.4 million.
The Company recorded a tax provision of $0.3 million for the three-month period
ended September 30, 2005, versus a tax provision of $0.2 million for the
three-month period ended September 30, 2004.

         In fiscal 2006, the net income for the first quarter was $0.5 million
or $0.06 per basic and diluted share compared to net income of $0.2 million or
$0.03 per basic and diluted share for the first quarter of fiscal 2005. The
weighted average number of common shares outstanding, used in the calculation of
basic earnings per share for the first quarters of fiscal 2006 and 2005 were
7,829,577 and 7,818,432 shares respectively. The weighted average number of
common shares outstanding used in the calculation of diluted earnings per share
for the first quarters of fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 were 8,061,758 and
8,065,741 shares, respectively.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

         The Company believes that available resources and anticipated cash
flows from operations are sufficient to meet operating requirements in the
coming year.

         Working capital was $12.7 million at September 30, 2005 compared to
$12.2 million at June 30, 2005. This is primarily due to a $0.8 million increase
in accounts receivable, a $0.7 million increase in short-term investments, a
$0.1 million increase in inventories and a $0.4 million increase in other
current assets. These changes have been offset by a $1.2 million increase in
accounts payable and a $0.3 million increase in other accrued liabilities.



                                       13

         On August 25, 2005, the Board of Directors authorized repurchases of
shares of the Company's common stock pursuant to open market transactions in
accordance with Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act or in privately
negotiated block transactions. The authorization permits repurchases from time
to time until June 30, 2007 at the discretion of the Chairman of the Board or
the President and Chief Executive Officer. The authorization permits up to $1.0
million to be applied to such repurchases. No specific number of shares are
sought in connection with the authorization. The Company received the consent of
the Bank for this authorized repurchase. As of September 30, 2005 no shares have
been repurchased under this arrangement.

         On September 1, 2005, the Bank and the Company agreed to an amendment
of the credit facility. In conjunction with the amendment to the Company's
credit facility, the Bank extended the maturity on the Company's revolving
credit facility from April 24, 2007 to September 1, 2008. The entire credit
facility continues to accrue interest at the Bank's prime rate. The prime rate
was 6.75% on September 30, 2005. The interest rate on prime rate loans may
increase from prime to prime plus 0.75% if the ratio of the Company's funded
debt to EBITDA exceeds 2.5. The amended credit facility also provides the
Company with a rate of LIBOR plus 1.75%, at the Company's option. The optional
LIBOR rate may increase from LIBOR plus 1.75% to LIBOR plus 2.75% based on the
Company's fixed charge coverage ratio. The 90-day LIBOR rate was 4.07% at
September 30, 2005.

         At September 30, 2005 the Company had no aggregate indebtedness,
including capital lease obligations, short-term debt and long-term debt.

         The Company was in compliance with all of the financial covenants
associated with its credit facility at September 30, 2005.

         At September 30, 2005 the company had no balance outstanding against
this facility and $9.8 million available to borrow from the line based on
collateral requirements.

         In the event that economic conditions were to severely worsen for a
protracted period of time, we believe that our borrowing capacity under our
credit facilities will provide sufficient financial flexibility. The Company
would have options available to ensure liquidity in addition to increased
borrowing. Capital expenditures which are budgeted at $0.7 million for the
fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, could be postponed. At September 30, 2005, the
Company had no bank debt. Based on the Company's current level of debt, and
performance, debt would bear interest at the Bank's prime rate. The Company's
agreement with the Bank does include provisions for higher interest rates at
higher debt levels and different levels of Company performance.

         Inflation has not had a material effect on the Company's business or
results of operations.

LITIGATION AND CONTINGENCIES

         The Company becomes, from time to time, a party to personal injury
litigation arising out of incidents involving the use of its products. The
Company believes that any potential judgements resulting from these claims over
its self-insured retention will be covered by the Company's product liability
insurance.


ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK

         At September 30, 2005, the Company did not have any debt outstanding.
The Company's revolving credit facility bears an interest rate using the
commercial bank's "floating reference rate" or LIBOR as the basis, as defined in
the loan agreement, and therefore is subject to additional expense should there
be an increase in market interest rates.

         The Company had no holdings of derivative financial or commodity
instruments at September 30, 2005. Allied Healthcare Products has international
sales; however these sales are denominated in U.S. dollars, mitigating foreign
exchange rate fluctuation risk.

ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

         (a) As of September 30, 2005, the Company, under the supervision, and
with the participation, of its management, including its principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, performed an evaluation of the
Company's disclosure controls and procedures, as contemplated by Securities
Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Based on that evaluation, the Company's principal
executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that such disclosure
controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2005.

         (b) There has been no change in our internal controls over financial
reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2005, that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting.
