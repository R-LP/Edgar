SAFE HARBOR" STATEMENT UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT
OF 1995

         Statements contained in this Report, which are not historical facts or
information, are "forward-looking statements." Words such as "believe,"
"expect," "intend," "will," "should," and other expressions that indicate future
events and trends identify such forward-looking statements. These
forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which could cause
the outcome and future results of operations, and financial condition to be
materially different than stated or anticipated based on the forward-looking
statements. Such risks and uncertainties include both general economic risks and
uncertainties, risks and uncertainties affecting the demand for and economic
factors affecting the delivery of health care services, and specific matters
which relate directly to the Company's operations and properties as discussed in
the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2002. The
Company cautions that any forward-looking statements contained in this report
reflects only the belief of the Company or its management at the time the
statement was made. Although the Company believes such forward-looking
statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, such assumptions may
ultimately prove inaccurate or incomplete. The Company undertakes no obligation
to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after
the date on which the statement was made.

4.       New Accounting Standards

         In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 (SFAS 144), "Accounting for
the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets" which supercedes Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 121 (SFAS 121), "Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of" and the accounting and
reporting provisions of Accounting Principles Bulletin No. 30, "Reporting the
Results of Operations - Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a
Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and
Transactions", for the disposal of a business. SFAS 144 provides a single
accounting model for long-lived assets to be disposed of. Although retaining
many of the fundamental recognition and measurement provisions of SFAS 121, the
new rules change the criteria to be met to classify an asset as held-for-sale.
The new rules also broaden the criteria regarding classification of a
discontinued operation. The Company was required to adopt the provisions of SFAS
144 effective July 1, 2002. Adoption of SFAS 144 did not have a material impact
on the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

         In July 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 146 (SFAS 146), "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or
Disposal Activities" which addresses financial accounting and reporting for
costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies Emerging Issues
Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 94-3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee
Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain
Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)." SFAS 146 requires that a liability for a
cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the
liability is incurred. Under EITF Issue No. 94-3, a liability for an exit cost
was recognized at the date of an entity's commitment to an exit plan. The
provisions of SFAS 146 are effective for exit or disposal activities initiated
after December 31, 2002. Adoption of SFAS 146 is not expected to have a material
impact on the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

         In December 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 148 (SFAS 148), "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation -
Transition and Disclosure - an amendment of FAS 123," which provides alternative
methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of
accounting for stock-based employee compensation. Additionally, SFAS 148 amends
the disclosure requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
123 (SFAS 123), "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," to require prominent
disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of
accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method
used on reported results. The provisions of SFAS 148 are effective for financial
statements issued for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002 and for
financial reports containing condensed financial statements for interim periods
beginning after December 15, 2002. Adoption of SFAS 148 is not expected to have
a material impact on the Company's results of operations, financial position or
cash flows.

5.       Commitments and Contingencies

         The Company is subject to various investigations, claims and legal
proceedings covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course
of its business activities. The Company has recognized the costs and associated
liabilities only for those investigations, claims and legal proceedings for
which, in its view, it is probable that liabilities have been incurred and the
related amounts are estimable. Based upon information currently available,
management believes that existing accrued liabilities are sufficient and that it
is not reasonably possible at this time to believe that any additional
liabilities will result from the resolution of these matters that would have a
material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations,
financial position or cash flows.



6.       Financing Agreement Amendment

         On April 24, 2002, the Company entered into a new credit facility
arrangement with LaSalle Bank National Association (the Bank). The credit
facility provides for total borrowings up to $19.0 million; consisting of $15.0
million through a revolving credit facility and up to $4.0 million under a term
loan for capital equipment.

         On September 26, 2002, the Bank amended the Company's credit facility
(the amended credit facility). The Bank amended various financial covenants in
conjunction with the amended credit facility to include a quarterly fixed charge
coverage ratio and EBITDA ratio through June 30, 2003, which are adjusted on an
annual basis beginning on July 1, 2003. At December 31, 2002, the Company was in
compliance with its financial covenants under the amended credit facility.
Although the Company was in compliance with its financial covenants under the
amended credit facility at December 31, 2002, the ability of the Company to
remain in compliance with these ratios for the remainder of the current fiscal
year depends on the cumulative operating results and related EBITDA for year to
date periods and is subject to achieving satisfactory revenue and expense levels
sufficient to enable the Company to meet heightened performance standards.
During the first six months of the 2003 fiscal year the Company realized EBITDA,
as defined, of approximately $500,000. During the nine months ended March 31,
2003 and the year ending June 30, 2003, the Company must realize EBITDA of
approximately $1,500,000 and $2,600,000 respectively. While the Company believes
such performance results are attainable, there can be no assurance that they
will be achieved.

         In addition, the outstanding loans under the amended credit facility
bear interest at an annual interest rate at the Bank's prime rate plus 0.75% and
the Company will no longer have an option to elect a LIBOR rate of interest for
its outstanding borrowings. The Company's per annum fee on any outstanding
letters of credit under the amended credit facility will be 2.50%. Under the
terms of the amended credit facility, the interest




                                       9
<PAGE>

rate on each loan outstanding at an Event of Default, as defined in the amended
credit facility, will bear interest at the rate of 2.00% per annum in excess of
the interest rate otherwise payable thereon and both principal and interest will
be payable on demand. The borrowing period under the term loan for capital
expenditures, which represent 80% of the purchase price of the related
equipment, was extended to eight months from the date of the original credit
facility.

         The Company's credit facility requires a lockbox arrangement, which
provides for all receipts to be swept daily to reduce borrowings outstanding
under the credit facility. This arrangement, combined with the existence of a
Material Adverse Effect (MAE) clause in the new credit facility, cause the
revolving credit facility to be classified as a current liability, per guidance
in the FASB's EITF Issue No. 95-22, "Balance Sheet Classification of Borrowings
Outstanding under Revolving Credit Agreements that Include Both a Subjective
Acceleration Clause and a Lock-Box Arrangement." However, the Company does not
expect to repay, or be required to repay, within one year, the balance of the
revolving credit facility classified as a current liability. The MAE clause,
which is a typical requirement in commercial credit agreements, allows the
lender to require the loan to become due if it determines there has been a
material adverse effect on the Company's operations, business, properties,
assets, liabilities, condition or prospects. The classification of the revolving
credit facility as a current liability is a result only of the combination of
the two aforementioned factors: the lockbox arrangement and the MAE clause.
However, the revolving credit facility does not expire or have a maturity date
within one year, but rather has a final expiration date of April 25, 2005.
Additionally, the Bank has not notified the Company of any indication of a MAE
at December 31, 2002.


ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED
DECEMBER 31, 2001.

         Allied had net sales of $14.9 million for the three months ended
December 31, 2002, down $0.5 million, or 3.2%, from net sales of $15.4 million
in the prior year same quarter. Sales in the second quarter of the prior year
were favorably impacted by improved production performance and the timing of
orders released for shipment following the events of September 11, 2001. During
the first quarter of fiscal 2002 customers delayed order releases following the
events of September 11, 2001. These orders were released for shipment in the
second quarter. Sales in the second quarter of the prior year were also
favorably impacted by the resolution of production issues which delayed
shipments in the first quarter of fiscal 2002. These sales did not recur in the
second quarter of fiscal 2003.






                                       10
<PAGE>

         Gross profit for the three months ended December 31, 2002 was $3.4
million, or 22.8% of net sales, compared to $3.6 million, or 23.6% of net sales,
for the three months ended December 31, 2001. This decrease is a result of the
decrease in sales during the period. In addition, during the second quarter of
fiscal 2002 the Company began moving the production of the Company's line of B&F
disposable products into the Company's St. Louis production facility to improve
delivery performance This move has resulted in higher production cost during the
second quarter of fiscal 2003 than in the second quarter of fiscal 2002 . The
Company is continuing to review, automate, and further improve operations to
improve productivity and lower manufacturing and product cost.

         Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended
December 31, 2002 were $3.4 million, a net increase of $0.2 million, or 7.9%,
from $3.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2001. The increase is
primarily attributable to a $0.2 million increase in insurance cost. The
increase in insurance cost is the result of widespread price increases in the
insurance market, and product liability claims experienced by the Company in
prior years.

         Loss from operations was $0.04 million for the three months ended
December 31, 2002 compared to $0.5 million income for the three months ended
December 31, 2001. Interest expense was $0.2 million for the three months ended
December 31, 2002 compared to $0.3 million for the three months ended December
31, 2001. Allied had a loss before benefit for income taxes in the second
quarter of fiscal 2003 of $0.3 million compared to income before provision for
income taxes of $0.2 million, for the second quarter of fiscal 2002. The Company
recorded a tax benefit of $0.1 million for the three-month period ended December
31, 2002 versus a tax provision of $0.1 million recorded for the three-month
period ended December 31, 2001.

         In fiscal 2003, the net loss for the second quarter was $0.2 million or
$0.02 per basic and diluted share compared to net income of $0.1 million, or
$0.01 per basic and diluted share for the second quarter of fiscal 2002. The
weighted average number of common shares outstanding used in the calculation of
basic earnings per share for the second quarters of fiscal 2003 and 2002 was
7,813,932 and 7,806,682 shares, respectively. The weighted average number of
common shares outstanding used in the calculation of diluted earnings per share
for the second quarters of fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002 was 7,813,932 and
7,953,043 shares, respectively.


SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 COMPARED TO SIX MONTHS ENDED
DECEMBER 31, 2001.

         Allied had net sales of $30.1 million for the six months ended December
31, 2002, up $0.6 million, or 1.9%, from net sales of $29.5 million in the prior
year same period. The increase in sales is primarily a result of increased
shipments resulting from improvements in shipping and production performance
from the prior year.






                                       11
<PAGE>

         Gross profit for the six months ended December 31, 2002 was $6.6
million, or 21.8% of net sales, compared to $6.5 million, or 21.9% of net sales,
for the six months ended December 31, 2001. The increase in gross profit is
primarily attributable to increased sales. The Company is continuing to review,
automate, and further improve operations to improve productivity and lower
manufacturing and product cost.

         Selling, general and administrative expenses for the six months ended
December 31, 2002 were $6.7 million, a net increase of $0.2 million, or 3.2%,
from $6.5 million for the six months ended December 31, 2001. This increase is
attributable to a $0.3 million increase in insurance cost. The increase in
insurance cost is the result of price increases in the insurance market, and
product liability claims experienced by the Company in prior years. The increase
in insurance cost was partially offset by a $0.1 million reduction in lease
amortization on the Company's computer systems.

         Loss from operations was $0.2 million for the six months ended December
31, 2002 compared to a $0.1 million loss for the six months ended December 31,
2001. Interest expense was $0.4 million for the six months ended December 31,
2002 compared to $0.6 million for the six months ended December 31, 2001. Allied
had a loss before benefit for income taxes for the first six months of fiscal
2003 of $0.6 million compared to a loss before benefit for income taxes of $0.7
million for the first six months of fiscal 2002. The Company recorded a tax
benefit of $0.2 million and $0.3 million for the six-month periods ended
December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

         In fiscal 2003, the net loss for the first six months was $0.4 million,
or $0.05 per basic and diluted share compared to a net loss of $0.4 million or
$0.05 per basic and diluted share for the first six months of fiscal 2002. The
weighted average number of common shares outstanding used in the calculation of
basic and diluted earnings per share for the first six months of fiscal 2003 and
fiscal 2002 was 7,813,932 and 7,806,682 shares, respectively.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

         The Company believes that available resources and anticipated cash
flows from operations are sufficient to meet operating requirements in the
coming year.

         Working capital increased to $10.7 million at December 31, 2002
compared to $9.4 million at June 30, 2002. The increase was primarily due to the
conversion of $1.0 million of revolver debt to the Company's term loan for
capital expenditures, and a $0.3 million increase in other current assets,
primarily prepaid expenses. Accounts receivable declined by $1.3 million as a
result of decreased sales during the first six months of the 2003 fiscal year,
offset by a $1.2 million increase in inventory resulting, in part, from lower
than expected demand during the second quarter. Management continues to review
inventory control procedures and expects these components to be used in the
normal course of business, although it is expected that inventories will exceed
targeted levels through much of calendar year 2003.

         On April 24, 2002, the Company entered into a new credit facility
arrangement with LaSalle Bank National Association (the Bank). The credit
facility provides for total borrowings up to $19.0 million; consisting of up to
$15.0 million through a revolving credit facility and up to $4.0 million under a
term loan.

         On September 26, 2002, the Bank amended the Company's credit facility
(the amended credit facility). The Bank amended various financial covenants in
conjunction with the amended credit facility to include a quarterly fixed charge
coverage ratio and EBITDA ratio through June 30, 2003, which are adjusted on an
annual basis beginning on July 1, 2003. Although the Company was in compliance
with its financial covenants under the amended credit facility at December 31,
2002, the ability of the Company to remain in compliance with these ratios for
the remainder of the current fiscal year depends on the cumulative operating
results and related EBITDA for year to date periods and is subject to achieving
satisfactory revenue and expense levels sufficient to enable the Company to meet
heightened performance standards. During the first six months of the 2003 fiscal
year the Company realized EBITDA, as defined, of approximately $500,000. During
the nine months ended March 31, 2003 and the year ending June 30, 2003, the
Company must realize EBITDA of approximately $1,500,000 and $2,600,000
respectively. While the Company believes such performance results are
attainable, there can be no assurance that they will be achieved.


         In addition, the outstanding loans under the amended credit facility
bear interest at the Bank's prime rate plus 0.75% and the Company will no longer
have an option to elect a LIBOR rate of interest for its outstanding borrowings.
The Company's per annum fee on any outstanding letters of credit under the
amended credit facility will be 2.50%. Under the terms of the amended credit
facility, the interest rate on each loan outstanding at an Event of Default, as
defined in the amended credit facility, will bear interest at the rate of 2.00%
per annum in excess of the interest rate otherwise payable thereon and both
principal and interest payments will be payable on demand. The borrowing period
under the term loan for capital expenditures, which represent 80% of the
purchase price of the related equipment, was extended to eight months from the
date of the original credit facility.

         The Company's credit facility requires a lockbox arrangement, which
provides for all receipts to be swept daily to reduce borrowings outstanding
under the credit facility. This arrangement, combined with the existence of a
Material Adverse Effect (MAE) clause in the new credit facility, cause the
revolving credit facility to be classified as a current liability, per guidance
in the FASB's EITF Issue No. 95-22, "Balance Sheet Classification of Borrowings
Outstanding under Revolving Credit Agreements that Include Both a Subjective
Acceleration Clause and a Lock-Box Arrangement." However, the Company does not
expect to repay, or be required to repay, within one year, the balance of the
revolving credit facility classified as a current liability. The MAE clause,
which is a typical requirement in commercial credit agreements, allows the
lender to require the loan to become due if it determines there has been a
material adverse effect on the Company's operations, business, properties,
assets, liabilities, condition or prospects.



                                       13

The classification of the revolving credit facility as a current liability is a
result only of the combination of the two aforementioned factors: the lockbox
arrangement and the MAE clause. However, the revolving credit facility does not
expire or have a maturity date within one year, but rather has a final
expiration date of April 25, 2005. Additionally, the Bank has not notified the
Company of any indication of a MAE at December 31, 2002.

         At December 31, 2002, $9.2 million was outstanding against this
facility and $5.7 million was available to borrow from the line based on
collateral requirements.

         Inflation has not had a material effect on the Company's business or
results of operations.

LITIGATION AND CONTINGENCIES

         The Company becomes, from time to time, a party to personal injury
litigation arising out of incidents involving the use of its products. More
specifically there have been a number of lawsuits filed against the Company
alleging that its aluminum oxygen pressure regulator, marketed under its Life
Support Products label, has caused fires that have led to personal injury. The
Company believes, based on preliminary findings, that its products did not cause
the fires. The Company intends to defend these claims in cooperation with its
insurers. Based on the progression of certain cases, the Company has recorded
additional charges to operations during fiscal 2003 and 2002 for amounts
estimated to be payable by the Company under its self-insurance retention for
legal costs associated with defending these claims. The Company believes that
any potential judgements resulting from these claims over its self-insured
retention will be covered by the Company's product liability insurance.


ITEM 3.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK

         At December 31, 2002, the Company had $12.5 million in debt outstanding
of which $3.3 million is a term loan with a fixed interest rate of 7.75%. The
remaining balance represents amounts outstanding under the Company's revolving
credit facility of $6.2 million and the Company's capital expenditure loan for
$3.0 million. The revolving credit facility and capital expenditure loan bear an
interest rate using the commercial bank's "floating reference rate" as the
basis, as defined in the loan agreement, and therefore is subject to additional
expense should there be an increase in market interest rates.

         The Company had no holdings of derivative financial or commodity
instruments at December 31, 2002. Allied Healthcare Products has international
sales, however these sales are denominated in U.S. dollars, mitigating foreign
exchange rate fluctuation risk.
