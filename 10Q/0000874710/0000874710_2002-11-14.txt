SAFE HARBOR" STATEMENT UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF
1995

         Statements contained in this Report, which are not historical facts or
information, are "forward-looking statements." Words such as "believe,"
"expect," "intend," "will," "should," and other expressions that indicate future
events and trends identify such forward-looking statements. These
forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which could cause
the outcome and future results of operations, and financial condition to be
materially different than stated or anticipated based on the forward-looking
statements. Such risks and uncertainties include both general economic risks and
uncertainties, risks and uncertainties affecting the demand for and economic
factors affecting the delivery of health care services, and specific matters
which relate directly to the Company's operations and properties as discussed
the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2002. The
Company cautions that any forward-looking statements contained in this report
reflects only the belief of the Company or its management at the time the
statement was made. Although the Company believes such forward-looking
statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, such assumptions may
ultimately prove inaccurate or incomplete. The Company undertakes no obligation
to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after
the date on which the statement was made.

3.       Earnings per share

         Basic earnings per share are based on the weighted average number of
shares of all common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per
share are based on the sum of the weighted average number of shares of common
stock and common stock equivalents outstanding during the year. The number of
basic and diluted shares outstanding for the three months ended September 30,
2002 and 2001 was 7,813,932 and 7,806,682 shares, respectively.


4.       New Accounting Standards

            In August 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standard No. 144 (SFAS 144), "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets"



                                       7
<PAGE>

which supercedes Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121 (SFAS 121),
"Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of" and the
accounting and reporting provisions of APB No. 30, "Reporting the Results of
Operations - Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and
Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions", for
the disposal of a business. SFAS 144 provides a single accounting model for
long-lived assets to be disposed of. Although retaining many of the fundamental
recognition and measurement provisions of SFAS 121, the new rules change the
criteria to be met to classify an asset as held-for-sale. The new rules also
broaden the criteria regarding classification of a discontinued operation. The
Company was required to adopt the provisions of SFAS 144 effective July 1, 2002.
Adoption of SFAS 144 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's
results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

             In July 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 146 (SFAS 146), "Accounting for Cost Associated with Exit or
Disposal Activities" which addresses financial accounting and reporting for
costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies Emerging Issues
Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 94-3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee
Termination Benefits and Other Cost to Exit an Activity (including Certain Cost
Incurred in a Restructuring)." SFAS 146 requires that a liability for a cost
associated with an exit of disposal activity be recognized when the liability is
incurred. Under EITF Issue No. 94-3, a liability for an exit cost was recognized
when the liability is incurred. Under EITF Issue No. 94-3, a liability for an
exit cost was recognized at the date of an entity's commitment to an exit plan.
The provisions of SFAS 146 are effective for exit or disposal activities
initiated after December 31, 2002. Adoption of SFAS 146 is not expected to have
a material impact on the Company's results of operations, financial position or
cash flows.

5.       Commitments and Contingencies

         The Company is subject to various investigations, claims and legal
proceedings covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course
of its business activities. The Company has recognized the costs and associated
liabilities only for those investigations, claims and legal proceedings for
which, in its view, it is probable that liabilities have been incurred and the
related amounts are estimable. Based upon information currently available,
management believes that existing accrued liabilities are sufficient and that it
is not reasonably possible at this time to believe that any additional
liabilities will result from the resolution of these matters that would have a
material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations,
financial position or cash flows.


6.         Financing Agreement Amendment

            On April 24, 2002, the Company entered into a new credit facility
arrangement with LaSalle Bank National Association (the "Bank"). The credit
facility provides for borrowings up to $19.0 million; up to $15.0 million
through a revolving credit facility and



                                       8
<PAGE>

up to $4.0 million under a term loan. The term loan may be drawn against for
capital expenditures during the first six months of the term of the credit
facility.

         On September 26, 2002, the Bank amended the Company's credit facility
(the amended credit facility). The Bank amended various financial covenants in
conjunction with the amended credit facility to include a quarterly fixed
coverage charge ratio and EBITDA ratio through June 30, 2003, which are adjusted
to measurement on an annual basis beginning on July 1, 2003. At September 30,
2002, the Company was in compliance with its financial covenants under the
amended credit facility. In addition, the outstanding loans under the amended
credit facility will bear interest at an annual interest rate of 0.75% plus the
Bank's prime rate and the Company will no longer have an option to elect a LIBOR
rate of interest for its outstanding borrowings. The Company's per annum fee on
any outstanding letters of credit under the amended credit facility will be
2.50%. Under the terms of the amended credit facility, the interest rate on each
loan outstanding at an Event of Default, as defined in the amended credit
facility, will bear interest at the rate of 2.00% per annum in excess of the
interest rate otherwise payable thereon and interest payments will be payable on
demand. The borrowing period under the term loan for capital expenditures, which
represent 80% of the purchase price of the related equipment, has been extended
to eight months from the date of the original credit facility.

             The Company's credit facility requires a lockbox arrangement, which
provides for all receipts to be swept daily to reduce borrowings outstanding
under the credit facility. This arrangement, combined with the existence of a
Material Adverse Effect (MAE) clause in the new credit facility, cause the
revolving credit facility to be classified as a current liability, per guidance
in the FASB's Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 95-22, "Balance Sheet
Classification of Borrowings Outstanding under Revolving Credit Agreements that
Include Both a Subjective Acceleration Clause and a Lock-Box Arrangement."
However, the Company does not expect to repay, or be required to repay, within
one year, the balance of the revolving credit facility classified as a current
liability. The MAE clause, which is a typical requirement in commercial credit
agreements, allows the lender to require the loan to become due if it determines
there has been a material adverse effect on the Company's operations, business,
properties, assets, liabilities , condition or prospects. The classification of
the revolving credit facility as a current liability is a result only of the
combination of the two aforementioned factors: the lockbox arrangement and the
MAE clause. However, the revolving credit facility does not expire or have a
maturity date within one year, but rather has a final expiration date of April
25, 2005. Additionally, the Bank has not notified the Company of any indication
of a MAE at September 30, 2002.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2002 COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER
30, 2001.

         Allied had net sales of $15.2 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2002, up $1.1 million, or 7.7%, from net sales of $14.1 million in
the prior year same quarter. The increase in sales is primarily a result of
increased shipments resulting from improvements in production performance from
the prior year. Sales in the first quarter of the prior year were also impacted
by a delay in orders released for shipment following the events of September 11,
2001.

         Gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2002 was $3.2
million, or 20.9% of net sales compared to $2.8 million, or 20.0% of net sales
for the three months ended September 30, 2001. The Company is continuing to
review and improve operations to improve productivity and lower manufacturing
and product cost.

         Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended
September 30, 2002 were $3.3 million, a net decrease of $0.1 million, or 1.2%,
from $3.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2001. This decrease
is attributable to a $0.1 million reduction in lease amortization on the
Company's computer systems, a $0.1 million reduction in payments to outside
consultants, and a $0.1 million reduction in other selling, general and
administrative expenses. However, these savings were largely offset by a $0.2
million dollar increase in insurance cost. This increase in insurance cost is
the result of price increases in the insurance market, and product liability
claims experienced by the Company in prior years.

         Loss from operations was $0.1 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2002 compared to a $0.5 million loss for the three months ended
September 30, 2001. Interest expense was $0.2 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2002 compared to $0.3 million for the three months ended September
30, 2001. Allied had a loss before benefit for income taxes in the first quarter
of fiscal 2002 of $0.4 million compared to a loss before benefit for income
taxes of $0.9 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2001. The Company recorded
a tax benefit of $0.1 million and $0.3 million for the three-month periods ended
September 30, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

         In fiscal 2003, the net loss for the first quarter was $0.2 million, or
$0.03 per basic and diluted share compared to a net loss of $0.5 million or
$0.07 per basic and diluted share for the first quarter of fiscal 2002. The
weighted average number of common shares outstanding used in the calculation of
basic and diluted earnings per share for the first quarters of fiscal 2003 and
fiscal 2002 was 7,813,932 and 7,806,682 shares, respectively.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

         The Company believes that available resources and anticipated cash
flows from operations are sufficient to meet operating requirements in the
coming year.

         Working capital increased to $9.6 million at September 30, 2002
compared to $9.4 million at June 30, 2002. The increase was primarily due to a
decrease in accounts payable, partially offset by an increase in the current
portion of long-term debt.

         On April 24, 2002, the Company entered into a new credit facility
arrangement with LaSalle Bank National Association (the "Bank"). The credit
facility provides for borrowings up to $19.0 million; up to $15.0 million
through a revolving credit facility and up to $4.0 million under a term loan.
The term loan may be drawn against for capital expenditures during the first six
months of the term of the credit facility.

         On September 26, 2002, the Bank amended the Company's credit facility
(the amended credit facility). The Bank amended various financial covenants in
conjunction with the amended credit facility to include a quarterly fixed
coverage charge ratio and EBITDA ratio through June 30, 2003, which are adjusted
to measurement on an annual basis beginning on July 1, 2003. At September 30,
2002, the Company was in compliance with its financial covenants under the
amended credit facility. In addition, the outstanding loans under the amended
credit facility will bear interest at an annual interest rate of 0.75% plus the
Bank's prime rate and the Company will no longer have an option to elect a LIBOR
rate of interest for its outstanding borrowings. The Company's per annum fee on
any outstanding letters of credit under the amended credit facility will be
2.50%. Under the terms of the amended credit facility, the interest rate on each
loan outstanding at an Event of Default, as defined in the amended credit
facility, will bear interest at the rate of 2.00% per annum in excess of the
interest rate otherwise payable thereon and interest payments will be payable on
demand. The borrowing period under the term loan for capital expenditures, which
represent 80% of the purchase price of the related equipment, has been extended
to eight months from the date of the original credit facility.

         The Company's credit facility requires a lockbox arrangement, which
provides for all receipts to be swept daily to reduce borrowings outstanding
under the credit facility. This arrangement, combined with the existence of a
Material Adverse Effect (MAE) clause in the new credit facility, cause the
revolving credit facility to be classified as a current liability, per guidance
in the FASB's Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 95-22, "Balance Sheet
Classification of Borrowings Outstanding under Revolving Credit Agreements that
Include Both a Subjective Acceleration Clause and a Lock-Box Arrangement."
However, the Company does not expect to repay, or be required to repay, within
one year, the balance of the revolving credit facility classified as a current
liability. The MAE clause, which is a typical requirement in commercial credit
agreements, allows the lender to require the loan to become due if it determines
there has been a material adverse effect on the Company's operations, business,
properties, assets, liabilities , condition or prospects. The classification of
the revolving credit facility as a current liability is a result only of the
combination of the two aforementioned factors: the lockbox



                                       11

arrangement and the MAE clause. However, the revolving credit facility does not
expire or have a maturity date within one year, but rather has a final
expiration date of April 25, 2005. Additionally, the Bank has not notified the
Company of any indication of a MAE at September 30, 2002.

         At September 30, 2002, $9.6 million was outstanding against this
facility and $4.2 million was available to borrow from the line based on
collateral requirements.

         Inflation has not had a material effect on the Company's business or
results of operations.

LITIGATION AND CONTINGENCIES

         The Company becomes, from time to time, a party to personal injury
litigation arising out of incidents involving the use of its products. More
specifically there have been a number of lawsuits filed against the Company
alleging that its aluminum oxygen pressure regulator, marketed under its Life
Support Products label, has caused fires that have led to personal injury. The
Company believes, based on preliminary findings, that its products did not cause
the fires. The Company intends to defend these claims in cooperation with its
insurers. Based on the progression of certain cases, the Company has recorded
additional charges to operations during fiscal 2003 and 2002 for amounts
estimated to be payable by the Company under its self-insurance retention for
legal costs associated with defending these claims. The Company believes that
any potential judgements resulting from these claims over its self-insured
retention will be covered by the Company's product liability insurance.


ITEM 3.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK

         At September 30, 2002, the Company had $13.0 million in debt
outstanding, excluding capital leases, of which $3.4 million is a short term
loan with a fixed interest rate of 7.75%. The remaining balance represents
amounts outstanding under the Company's revolving credit facility of $7.9
million and the Company's capital expenditure loan for $1.7 million. The
revolving credit facility and capital expenditure loan bear an interest rate
using the commercial bank's "floating reference rate" as the basis, as defined
in the loan agreement, and therefore is subject to additional expense should
there be an increase in market interest rates.

         The Company had no holdings of derivative financial or commodity
instruments at September 30, 2002. Allied Healthcare Products has international
sales, however these sales are denominated in U.S. dollars, mitigating foreign
exchange rate fluctuation risk.

ITEM 4.     CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

         Within the 90 day period prior to the filing date of this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q, the Company, under the supervision, and with the
participation, of its management, including its principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, performed an evaluation of the Company's disclosure
controls and procedures, as contemplated by Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15.
Based on that evaluation, the Company's principal executive officer and
principal financial officer concluded that such disclosure controls and
procedures are effective to ensure that material information relating to the
Company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to them,
particularly during the period for which the periodic reports are being
prepared.

Changes in Internal Controls

         No significant changes were made in the Company's internal controls or
in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to
the date of the evaluation performed pursuant to Securities Exchange Act Rule
13a-15 referred to above.
