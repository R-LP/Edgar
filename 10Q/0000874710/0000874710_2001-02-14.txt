       The above amounts are net of a reserve for obsolete and excess inventory
of approximately $2.9 million at December 31, 2000 and June 30, 2000.

3.     Oxygen Regulator Recall

       On February 4, 1999, Allied announced a voluntary trade-in program for
aluminum oxygen regulators marketed under its Life Support Products label. These
products are used to regulate pressure of bottled oxygen for administration to
patients under emergency situations. Based upon U. S. Food and Drug
Administration ("FDA") recommendations that all manufacturers cease the use of
aluminum in oxygen regulators, the Company introduced new brass regulators and
also offered a trade-in program to existing users pursuant to which units with
aluminum regulators could be exchanged for new units with brass regulators at a
reduced price. In connection with this program, the Company recorded a charge of
$1.5 million pre-tax in the second quarter of fiscal 1999.


                                       7

<PAGE>   8


An additional $.3 million charge was added to the recall program in the first
quarter of fiscal 2000.

       A reconciliation of activity with respect to the Company's regulator
program for the six months ended December 31, 2000 is as follows:

</TABLE>

       The Company has incurred various legal expenses related to other claims
associated with the LSP oxygen regulators. Accordingly, the Company recorded a
$0.5 million charge to operations during fiscal 2000 for amounts estimated to be
payable by the company under its self-insurance retention for legal costs
associated with defending these claims. The company recorded an additional
$20,000 charge to operations during fiscal 2001. These amounts are included
along with other legal expenses of the Company as selling, general and
administrative expenses. At December 31, 2000, the Company has a litigation cost
accrual balance of $140,000 for legal expense associated with the LSP regulator
recall.

4.     Commitments and Contingencies

       The Company is subject to various investigations, claims and legal
proceedings covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course
of its business activities. In fiscal 2000, the FDA conducted an inspection of
the Company's St. Louis facility and provided a written report citing FDA
observations concerning Good Manufacturing Practices ("GMP") compliance and
quality control issues. The Company has provided written responses to the FDA
and is taking corrective action to mitigate any further FDA inquiry or action.
The Company believes that its responses to date and its continuing attention to
the matters raised by the FDA will avert any FDA action seeking to interrupt or
suspend manufacturing, or to require any recall or modification of products.
Based upon currently available information, the Company does not believe that
the FDA investigation will have a material adverse impact on the Company's
consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

       The Company has recognized the costs and associated liabilities only for
those investigations, claims and legal proceedings for which, in its view, it is
probable that liabilities have been incurred and the related amounts are
estimable. Based upon information currently available, management believes that
existing accrued liabilities are sufficient and that it is not reasonably
possible at this time that any additional liabilities will result from the
resolution of these matters that would have a material adverse effect on the
Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS.


The following discussion may contain statements that constitute "forward-looking
statements" as that term is used in the Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995. Such forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties as further
discussed in the Company's 2000 Annual Report filed on Form 10-K. Actual results
in future periods could differ significantly from results discussed in or
anticipated by such forward looking statements. This discussion should be read
in conjunction with the June 30, 2000 consolidated financial statements and
accompanying notes thereto included in the Company's Form 10-K for the year
ended June 30, 2000 and the unaudited financial statements and notes for the
three month and six month periods ended December 31, 2000.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Allied manufactures and markets medical gas equipment, respiratory care
products, and emergency medical products.

THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31,
1999.

Allied had net sales of $16.3 million for the three months ended December 31,
2000, down $.4 million, or 2.6%, from net sales of $16.8 million in the prior
year same quarter. The decline is primarily due to lower sales of oxygen
regulators this year due to an exchange program last year which increased sales
beyond normal levels. This was partially offset by higher sales in the second
quarter this year of medical gas equipment. Also, production problems caused
shipment shortfalls in the December fiscal 2001 quarter. Additional employees
are being hired to increase production levels. Order backlog at December 31,
2000 was up by approximately $1.3 million from September 30, 2000.

Gross profit for the three months ended December 31, 2000 was $4.4 million, or
27.1% of net sales compared to $4.6 million, or 27.6% of net sales for the three
months ended December 31, 1999. The decrease in gross profit as a percent of
sales is primarily attributable to lower sales volumes in the second quarter of
fiscal 2001.

Selling, General and Administrative expenses for the three months ended December
31, 2000 were $4.0 million, a net decrease of $0.3 million, or 6.0%, from $4.3
million for the three months ended December 31, 1999. The decrease was primarily
due to cost reduction efforts that were initiated during the second quarter of
last year, primarily a 15% staff reduction.

Income from operations was $.4 million for the three months ended December 31,
2000 compared to $.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 1999.
Interest expense was $.4 million in both comparable periods. Allied had a loss
before benefit for income taxes in the second quarter of fiscal 2001 of $15,000
compared to a loss before benefit for income taxes of $75,000 for the second
quarter of fiscal 2000. The Company recorded a tax provision of $75,000

and $51,000 for the three month periods ended December 31, 2000 and 1999,
respectively. In fiscal 2001, the net loss for the second quarter was $91,000,
or $0.01 per basic and diluted share compared to a net loss of $126,000, or
$0.02 per basic and diluted share, for the second quarter of fiscal 2000. The
weighted average number of common shares outstanding used in the calculation of
earnings per share for the second quarters of fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000 was
7,806,682.

SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 COMPARED TO SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31,
1999.

Allied had net sales of $30.9 million for the six months ended December 31,
2000, down $1.9 million, or 5.8%, from net sales of $32.8 million in the prior
year first six months. The decline was primarily due to lower sales of oxygen
regulators this year due to an exchange program last year which increased sales
beyond normal levels. Also, sales were adversely affected by a strike by
production workers at the Company's St. Louis plant in the first quarter and
subsequent delays in returning to adequate production and shipment levels.
Although the strike was settled on July 30, 2000 with a new three year contract,
the Company has had difficulty returning to normal production levels due to new
employee training and component shortages. The Company believes it is achieving
normal production levels at December 31, 2000. Order backlog at December 31,
2000 was up by approximately $2.9 million from June 30, 2000.

Gross profit for the six months ended December 31, 2000 was $8.2 million, or
26.5% of net sales compared to $8.7 million, or 26.4% of net sales for the six
months ended December 31, 1999. The primary reasons for the lower gross profit
were expenses which did not decrease with lower sales in the six months ended
December 31, 2000 and product mix. The Company will continue to review
operations to improve productivity and lower manufacturing and product costs.

Selling, General and Administrative expenses for the six months ended December
31, 2000 were $7.8 million, a net decrease of $1.11 million, or 12.5%, from $8.9
million for the six months ended December 31, 1999. The decrease was primarily
due to cost reduction efforts that were not initiated until the second quarter
of last year, primarily a 15% staff reduction. Expense in the prior year first
half also included a $.4 million charge for product liability litigation
expenses.

In the first half of fiscal 2000, the Company recorded a $.3 million additional
charge for expenses related to the LSP oxygen regulators program. Please see
Note 3 to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Income from operations was $.4 million for the six months ended December 31,
2000 compared to a $.6 million loss for the six months ended December 31, 1999.
Interest expense was $0.8 million for the six months ended December 31, 2000
compared to $.9 million for the six months ended December 31, 1999. Allied had a
loss before benefit for income taxes in the first half of fiscal 2001 of $.5
million compared to a loss before benefit for income taxes of $1.4 million for
the first half of fiscal 2000. The Company recorded a tax benefit of $20,000 and
$0.4 million for the six month periods ended December 31, 2000 and 1999,
respectively.

In fiscal 2001, the net loss for the first half was $0.4 million, or $0.06 per
basic and diluted share compared to a net loss of $1.0 million, or $0.13 per
basic and diluted share, for the first half of

fiscal 2000. The weighted average number of common shares outstanding used in
the calculation of earnings per share for the first quarters of fiscal 2001 and
fiscal 2000 was 7,806,682.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

We believe that available resources and anticipated cash flows from operations
are sufficient to meet our operating requirements in the coming year.

Working capital increased to $21.8 million at December 31, 2000 compared to
$20.3 million at June 30, 2000. The increase was primarily due to an increase in
accounts receivable and other current assets offset by increases in accounts
payable and other current liabilities.

The Company maintains a $25 million revolving credit facility. At December 31,
2000, $9.3 million was outstanding against this facility and $3.9 million was
available to borrow based on collateral requirements.

Inflation has not had a material effect on the Company's business or results of
operations.

LITIGATION AND CONTINGENCIES

The Company becomes, from time to time, a party to personal injury litigation
arising out of incidents involving the use of its products. More specifically
there have been a number of lawsuits filed against the Company alleging that its
aluminum oxygen pressure regulator, marketed under its Life Support Products
label, has caused fires that have led to personal injury. The Company believes,
based on preliminary findings, that its products did not cause the fires. The
Company intends to defend these claims in cooperation with its insurers. Based
on the progression of certain cases the Company recorded a $0.5 million charge
to operations during fiscal 2000 for amounts estimated to be payable by the
Company under its self-insurance retention for legal costs associated with
defending these claims. The Company believes that any potential judgments
resulting from these claims over its self-insured retention will be covered by
the Company's product liability insurance.

The Company is subject to various investigations, claims and legal proceedings
covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of its
business activities. In fiscal 2000, the FDA conducted an inspection of the
Company's St. Louis facility and provided a written report citing FDA
observations concerning Good Manufacturing Practices ("GMP") compliance and
quality control issues. The Company has provided written responses to the FDA
and is taking corrective action to mitigate any further FDA inquiry or action.
The Company believes that its responses to date and its continuing attention to
the matters raised by the FDA will avert any FDA action seeking to interrupt or
suspend manufacturing, or to require any recall or modification of products.
Based upon currently available information, the Company does not believe that
the FDA investigation will have a material adverse impact on the Company's
results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
