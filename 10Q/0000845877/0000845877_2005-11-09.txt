Item 1. Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

     The following interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
of  the  Federal   Agricultural   Mortgage  Corporation  ("Farmer  Mac"  or  the
"Corporation")  have been prepared  pursuant to the rules and regulations of the
Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (the  "SEC").   These  interim  unaudited
condensed  consolidated  financial  statements  reflect all normal and recurring
adjustments that are, in the opinion of management,  necessary to present a fair
statement of the  financial  condition  and the results of  operations  and cash
flows of Farmer Mac for the interim periods presented.  Certain  information and
footnote  disclosures   normally  included  in  annual  consolidated   financial
statements  have been  condensed  or  omitted  as  permitted  by such  rules and
regulations.  Management  believes that the  disclosures are adequate to present
fairly the condensed  consolidated  financial position,  condensed  consolidated
results of operations and condensed  consolidated cash flows as of the dates and
for the  periods  presented.  These  interim  unaudited  condensed  consolidated
financial  statements  should  be read in  conjunction  with  the  audited  2004
consolidated  financial  statements of Farmer Mac included in the  Corporation's
Annual  Report on Form 10-K for the year ended  December 31,  2004.  Results for

Note 1.  Accounting Policies

          (a)  Cash and Cash Equivalents

     Farmer Mac considers  highly liquid  investment  securities  with remaining
maturities  of  three  months  or  less  at the  time  of  purchase  to be  cash
equivalents. Changes in the balance of cash and cash equivalents are reported in
the condensed  consolidated  statements of cash flows.  The following table sets
forth information  regarding certain cash and non-cash transactions for the nine
months ended September 30, 2005 and 2004.

</TABLE>
          (b)  Allowance for Losses

     As of September 30, 2005,  Farmer Mac maintained an allowance for losses to
cover estimated probable losses on loans held for investment, real estate owned,
and loans  underlying  long-term  standby  purchase  commitments  ("LTSPCs") and
Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities  issued after the Farm Credit  System Reform
Act of  1996  (the  "1996  Act")  in  accordance  with  Statement  of  Financial
Accounting  Standards  No.  5,  Accounting  for  Contingencies  ("SFAS  5")  and
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 114, Accounting by Creditors for
Impairment of a Loan, as amended ("SFAS 114").

     The allowance for losses is increased through periodic  provisions for loan
losses that are charged  against net interest  income and  provisions for losses
that are charged to operating  expense and is reduced by charge-offs  for actual
losses, net of recoveries. Negative provisions for loan losses or provisions for
losses are recorded in the event that the estimate of probable  losses as of the
end of a period is lower than the estimate at the beginning of the period.

     Historically,  Farmer Mac  estimated  probable  losses  using a  systematic
process that began with management's  evaluation of the results of a proprietary
loan pool  simulation and guarantee fee model.  That model drew upon  historical
information  from a data set of agricultural  mortgage loans screened to include
only those  loans with  credit  characteristics  similar to those  eligible  for
Farmer Mac's programs.  The results  generated by that model were then modified,
as necessary, by the application of management's judgment.

     During third  quarter 2005,  Farmer Mac completed the planned  migration of
its  methodology for determining its allowance for losses away from one based on
its loan  pool  simulation  and  guarantee  fee  model  to one  based on its own
historical portfolio loss experience and credit trends.  Farmer Mac recorded the
effects of that change as a change in  accounting  estimate as of September  30,
2005.

     Farmer Mac's new  methodology  for  determining  its  allowance  for losses
incorporates the Corporation's proprietary automated loan classification system.
That  system  scores  loans  based  on  criteria  such as  historical  repayment
performance, loan seasoning, loan size and loan-to-value ratio. For the purposes
of the loss allowance methodology,  the loans in Farmer Mac's portfolio of loans
and loans underlying post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs
have been scored and  classified  for each calendar  quarter since first quarter
2000. The new allowance methodology captures the migration of loan scores across
concurrent  and  overlapping  3-year time  horizons  and  calculates  loss rates
separately within each loan classification for loans underlying LTSPCs and loans
and loans  underlying  post-1996  Act Farmer Mac I  Guaranteed  Securities.  The
calculated loss rates are applied to the current classification  distribution of
Farmer Mac's portfolio to estimate  inherent losses,  on the assumption that the
historical  credit losses and trends used to calculate  loss rates will continue
in the future. Management evaluates this assumption by taking into consideration
several factors, including:

     o    economic conditions;
     o    geographic and agricultural  commodity/product  concentrations  in the
          portfolio;
     o    the credit profile of the portfolio;
     o    delinquency trends of the portfolio; and
     o    historical charge-off and recovery activities of the portfolio.

If, based on that  evaluation,  management  concludes that the assumption is not
valid,  the loss  allowance  calculation  is modified by the addition of further
assumptions to capture current portfolio trends and characteristics  that differ
from historical experience.

     As of September 30, 2005,  Farmer Mac concluded  that the credit profile of
its portfolio was  consistent  with Farmer Mac's  historical  credit profile and
trends.  Management  believes that the allowance  for losses  adequately  covers
probable losses inherent in its portfolio under SFAS 5 and SFAS 114.

     The  following  table  summarizes  the changes in the  components of Farmer
Mac's  allowance  for losses for the three and nine months ended  September  30,
2005 and 2004:

</TABLE>

     No  allowance  for losses has been made for loans  underlying  Farmer Mac I
Guaranteed  Securities  issued prior to the 1996 Act or securities  issued under
the Farmer Mac II program ("Farmer Mac II Guaranteed Securities").  Farmer Mac I
Guaranteed Securities issued prior to the 1996 Act are supported by unguaranteed
first loss  subordinated  interests,  which are expected to exceed the estimated
credit losses on those loans. The guaranteed portions collateralizing Farmer Mac
II Guaranteed  Securities  are  guaranteed  by the United  States  Department of
Agriculture  ("USDA").  Each USDA guarantee is an obligation  backed by the full
faith and credit of the United States.  To date,  Farmer Mac has  experienced no
credit  losses on any pre-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities or on any
Farmer Mac II Guaranteed Securities and does not expect to incur any such losses
in the future.

     As of September 30, 2005, Farmer Mac individually analyzed $47.3 million of
its $94.8 million of impaired assets for collateral  shortfalls  against updated
appraised  values,  other updated  collateral  valuations or discounted  values.
Farmer Mac evaluated the  remaining  $47.5 million of impaired  assets for which
updated valuations were not available in the aggregate in consideration of their
similar risk characteristics and historical statistics.  Of the $47.3 million of
assets  analyzed,  $42.5 million were  adequately  collateralized.  For the $4.8
million of assets that were not adequately collateralized, individual collateral
shortfalls  totaled $0.5  million.  Accordingly,  Farmer Mac  recorded  specific
allowances of $0.5 million for those under-collateralized assets as of September
30, 2005.  As of  September  30,  2005,  in addition to the specific  allowances
provided,  Farmer  Mac  recorded  non-specific  or general  allowances  of $10.4
million, bringing the total allowance for losses to $10.9 million.

     The balance of impaired  assets,  both on- and off-balance  sheet,  and the
related  allowance  specifically  allocated  to  those  impaired  assets  as  of
September 30, 2005 and December 31, 2004 are summarized in the following table:

            (c) Financial Derivatives

     Farmer Mac enters into  financial  derivative  transactions  principally to
protect against risk from the effects of market price or interest rate movements
on the value of certain assets and future cash flows or debt  issuance,  not for
trading or  speculative  purposes.  Farmer Mac enters  into  interest  rate swap
contracts  principally to adjust the  characteristics  of its short-term debt to
match more closely the cash flow and duration characteristics of its longer-term
mortgage  and  other  assets,  and also to  adjust  the  characteristics  of its
long-term debt to match more closely the cash flow and duration  characteristics
of  its  short-term   assets,   thereby  reducing   interest  rate  risk.  These
transactions  also may provide an overall lower effective cost of borrowing than
would otherwise be available in the conventional debt market.

     All financial  derivatives  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value
as  a  freestanding  asset  or  liability.   Financial  derivatives  in  hedging
relationships  that mitigate exposure to changes in the fair value of assets are
considered  fair value hedges.  Financial  derivatives in hedging  relationships
that mitigate the exposure to the  variability in expected  future cash flows or
other  forecasted  transactions  are  considered  cash  flow  hedges.  Financial
derivatives  that do not satisfy the hedging  criteria of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative  Instruments and Hedging
Activities, as amended ("SFAS 133") are not accounted for as hedges, and changes
in the fair  values of those  financial  derivatives  are  reported  as gains or
losses on financial derivatives and trading assets in the condensed consolidated
statements of operations.

     As of September 30, 2005, Farmer Mac had approximately $19.2 million of net
after-tax  unrealized  losses on cash flow hedges included in accumulated  other
comprehensive income/(loss). These amounts will be reclassified into earnings in
the same  period or  periods  during  which the hedged  forecasted  transactions
(either  the payment of interest  or the  issuance  of  discount  notes)  affect
earnings  or  immediately  when it becomes  probable  that the  original  hedged
forecasted  transaction  will not occur  within  two  months  of the  originally
specified  date.  Over the next twelve  months,  Farmer Mac estimates  that $3.7
million of the amount  currently  reported in  accumulated  other  comprehensive
income/(loss)  will  be  reclassified  into  earnings.  For  the  quarter  ended
September   30,   2005,   Farmer  Mac  recorded  a  gain  of  $0.2  million  for
ineffectiveness related to Farmer Mac's designated hedges.

            (d) Earnings Per Common Share

     Basic earnings per common share are based on the weighted-average number of
shares of common stock outstanding.  Diluted earnings per common share are based
on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding adjusted to
include all potentially  dilutive common stock options.  The following  schedule
reconciles basic and diluted earnings per common share ("EPS") for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2005 and 2004:

</TABLE>

     During third quarter 2005,  Farmer Mac  repurchased  191,810  shares of its
Class C Non-Voting Common Stock at an average price of $24.56 per share pursuant
to the  Corporation's  previously  announced  stock  repurchase  program.  These
repurchases  reduced the  Corporation's  capital by approximately  $4.7 million.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2005, Farmer Mac repurchased  756,252
shares of its Class C  Non-Voting  Common  Stock at an average  price of $20.70,
which reduced the Corporation's capital by approximately $15.7 million.

            (e) Stock-Based Compensation

     Farmer Mac accounts for its stock-based  employee  compensation plans using
the intrinsic value method of accounting for employee stock options  pursuant to
Accounting  Principles  Board  Opinion No. 25,  Accounting  for Stock  Issued to
Employees  ("APB  25"),  and  has  adopted  the  disclosure-only  provisions  of
Statement of Financial  Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation,  as amended ("SFAS 123"). Accordingly, no compensation expense was
recognized in third quarter 2005 or third quarter 2004 for employee stock option
plans.  Had Farmer Mac elected to use the fair value  method of  accounting  for
employee stock options, net income available to common stockholders and earnings
per share for the three and nine months ended  September 30, 2005 and 2004 would
have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated in the following table:

            (f) Reclassifications

     Certain  reclassifications of prior period information were made to conform
to the current period presentation.

            (g) New Accounting Standards

     In March 2004, the Emerging  Issues Task Force ("EITF")  amended EITF 03-1,
The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary  Impairment, to introduce a three-step model
to: (1) determine  whether an investment is impaired;  (2) evaluate  whether the
impairment  is  other-than-temporary;  and (3) account for  other-than-temporary
impairments. In part, this amendment requires companies to apply qualitative and
quantitative  measures  to  determine  whether a decline  in the fair value of a
security is  other-than-temporary.  The guidance in EITF 03-1 is  effective  for
reporting  periods  beginning after June 15, 2004, with the exception of certain
sections,  which have been deferred.  Farmer Mac is evaluating the impact of the
deferred  portions of the amendment and will adopt them when  effective.  In the
interim,  Farmer  Mac  continues  to  apply  earlier  authoritative   accounting
guidance,  primarily SFAS 115 and EITF 99-20, Recognition of Interest Income and
Impairment  on  Purchased  and  Retained  Beneficial  Interests  in  Securitized
Financial  Assets,  for the measurement and recognition of  other-than-temporary
impairment of its debt and equity securities.

     In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
No. 123 (revised 2004),  Share-Based  Payment ("SFAS 123(R)").  SFAS 123(R) is a
revision  of SFAS  123 and  supersedes  APB 25 and  its  related  implementation
guidance.  SFAS 123(R)  requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee
services  received in exchange for an award of equity  instruments  based on the
grant-date fair value of the award. That cost will be recognized over the period
during  which an employee is  required  to provide  service in exchange  for the
award.  The  grant-date  fair  value  of  employee  share  options  and  similar
instruments  will be  estimated  using  option-pricing  models  adjusted for the
unique  characteristics  of  those  instruments.   SFAS  123(R)  eliminates  the
alternative  to use APB 25's  intrinsic  value  method  of  accounting  that was
provided in SFAS 123 as originally issued. Currently, as discussed in Note 1(e),
Farmer Mac accounts for its stock-based  employee  compensation  plans using the
intrinsic value method of accounting for employee stock options  pursuant to APB
25 and has adopted the  disclosure-only  provisions of SFAS 123. The guidance in
SFAS 123(R) is  effective  for  reporting  periods  beginning  no later than the
beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005.  Farmer Mac is
evaluating the impact of SFAS 123(R) and will adopt it when effective.

Fair value of beneficial interests retained
    in Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities                $ 1,310,131

Weighted-average remaining life (in years)                     4.6

Weighted-average prepayment speed (annual rate)               11.1%
    Effect on fair value of a 10% adverse change            $ (209)
    Effect on fair value of a 20% adverse change            $ (318)

Weighted-average discount rate                                 5.2%
    Effect on fair value of a 10% adverse change         $ (17,737)
    Effect on fair value of a 20% adverse change         $ (35,815)
</TABLE>

     These sensitivities are hypothetical.  As the figures indicate,  changes in
fair value based on 10 percent or 20 percent variations in assumptions generally
cannot be extrapolated  because the relationship of the change in assumptions to
the change in fair value may not be linear.  Also, in this table the effect of a
variation in a particular  assumption on the fair value of the retained interest
is calculated  without changing any other  assumption.  In fact,  changes in one
factor  may  result in changes in  another  (for  example,  increases  in market
interest  rates  may  result  in lower  prepayments),  which  might  amplify  or
counteract the sensitivities.

Note 3.  Off-Balance Sheet Guarantees and Long-Term Standby Purchase Commitments

Overview

     Farmer Mac offers  approved  agricultural  and rural  residential  mortgage
lenders two  off-balance  sheet  alternatives  to increase  their  liquidity  or
lending  capacity  while  retaining the cash flow  benefits of their loans:  (1)
Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities,  which are available through either the Farmer
Mac I program or the Farmer Mac II program,  and (2) LTSPCs, which are available
only  through  the Farmer Mac I program.  Both of these  alternatives  result in
off-balance sheet transactions for Farmer Mac.


Off-Balance Sheet Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities

     Periodically Farmer Mac transfers  agricultural  mortgage loans into trusts
that are used as vehicles for the  securitization of the transferred  assets and
the beneficial  interests in the trusts are sold to third party  investors.  The
table  below  summarizes  certain  cash  flows  received  from and paid to these
trusts.

     The temporary  unrealized  losses  presented  above are  principally due to
changes in interest rates from the date of acquisition to September 30, 2005 and
December 31, 2004.  Farmer Mac has the intent and ability to hold its investment
securities  in  unrealized  loss  positions  as of  September  30,  2005 for the
foreseeable future.

     As of September 30, 2005, Farmer Mac owned one held-to-maturity  investment
that matures in 2006 with an amortized  cost of $10.6  million,  a fair value of
$10.7 million, and a yield of 6.15 percent. As of September 30, 2005, Farmer Mac
owned trading investment securities that mature after 10 years with an amortized
cost of $7.5 million, a fair value of $7.6 million, and a weighted average yield
of 4.4 percent.  The  amortized  cost,  fair value and yield of  investments  by
remaining contractual maturity for  available-for-sale  investment securities as
of September 30, 2005 are set forth below. Asset- and mortgage-backed securities
are included based on their final maturities, although the actual maturities may

Item 2. Management's Discussion and  Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
        of Operations


     Please read the following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition  and Results of  Operations  in  conjunction  with:  (1) the unaudited
condensed  consolidated  financial  statements and the related notes that appear
elsewhere  in this report;  and (2) Farmer Mac's Annual  Report on Form 10-K for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004.

Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

     Certain  statements  made in this report are  "forward-looking  statements"
within  the  meaning of the  Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform Act of 1995
pertaining  to  management's  current  expectations  as to Farmer  Mac's  future
financial results, business prospects and business developments. Forward-looking
statements  include,  without  limitation,   any  statement  that  may  predict,
forecast,  indicate or imply future results,  performance or  achievements,  and
typically are accompanied by, and identified with, such terms as  "anticipates,"
"believes,"  "expects,"  "intends," "should" and similar phrases.  The following
management's  discussion  and  analysis  includes   forward-looking   statements
addressing Farmer Mac's:
     o    prospects for earnings;
     o    prospects for growth in loan purchase,  guarantee,  securitization and
          LTSPC volume;
     o    trends in net interest income;
     o    trends in provisions for losses;
     o    trends in expenses;
     o    changes in capital position; and
     o    other business and financial matters.

     Management's  expectations  for Farmer Mac's future  necessarily  involve a
number  of   assumptions   and  estimates  and  the   evaluation  of  risks  and
uncertainties. Various factors could cause Farmer Mac's actual results or events
to differ  materially  from the  expectations  as  expressed  or  implied by the
forward-looking statements, including uncertainties regarding:
     o    the rate and  direction of  development  of the  secondary  market for
          agricultural mortgage loans;
     o    the possible  establishment  of  additional  statutory  or  regulatory
          restrictions or constraints on Farmer Mac that could hamper its growth
          or diminish its profitability;
     o    increases  in general  and  administrative  expenses  attributable  to
          growth of the business and the regulatory  environment,  including the
          hiring of additional personnel with expertise in key functional areas;
     o    legislative or regulatory  developments or  interpretations  of Farmer
          Mac's statutory  charter that could  adversely  affect Farmer Mac, the
          ability  of  Farmer  Mac to  offer  new  products  or the  ability  or
          motivation of certain  lenders to  participate  in its programs or the
          terms of any such  participation,  or increase the cost of  regulation
          and related corporate activities;
     o    possible  reaction  in  the  financial  markets  to  events  involving
          government sponsored enterprises ("GSEs") other than Farmer Mac;
     o    Farmer Mac's access to the debt markets at favorable rates and terms;
     o    the  possible  effect of the  risk-based  capital  requirement,  which
          could,  under  certain  circumstances,  be in excess of the  statutory
          minimum capital requirement;
     o    the rate of growth in agricultural mortgage indebtedness;
     o    lender  interest  in Farmer  Mac  credit  products  and the Farmer Mac
          secondary market;
     o    borrower    preferences   for   fixed-rate    agricultural    mortgage
          indebtedness;
     o    competitive  pressures in the purchase of agricultural  mortgage loans
          and the  sale of  agricultural  mortgage-backed  securities  and  debt
          securities;
     o    substantial  changes in  interest  rates,  agricultural  land  values,
          commodity prices,  export demand for U.S. agricultural  products,  the
          general economy and other factors that may affect  delinquency  levels
          and credit losses;
     o    protracted  adverse  weather,  market  or other  conditions  affecting
          particular geographic regions or particular  agricultural  commodities
          or products related to agricultural  mortgage loans backing Farmer Mac
          I Guaranteed Securities or under LTSPCs;
     o    the willingness of investors to invest in agricultural mortgage-backed
          securities; or
     o    the effects on the  agricultural  economy or the value of agricultural
          real estate of any changes in federal assistance for agriculture.

     The foregoing factors are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report may
include additional factors that could adversely affect Farmer Mac's business and
its financial  performance.  Furthermore,  new risk factors  emerge from time to
time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor
assess the  effects of such  factors on Farmer  Mac's  business or the extent to
which any factor, or combination of factors,  may cause actual results to differ
materially  from the  expectations  expressed or implied by the  forward-looking
statements.  In light of  these  potential  risks  and  uncertainties,  no undue
reliance should be placed on any  forward-looking  statements  expressed in this
report. Furthermore, Farmer Mac undertakes no obligation to release publicly the
results  of  revisions  to any  forward-looking  statements  that may be made to
reflect any future events or circumstances,  except as otherwise mandated by the
SEC.

Critical Accounting Policy and Estimates

     The critical  accounting  policy that is both important to the portrayal of
Farmer Mac's financial condition and results of operations and requires complex,
subjective  judgments is the accounting policy for the allowance for losses. For
a discussion of Farmer Mac's critical accounting policy,  changes implemented in
its  methodology  for  determining its allowance for losses during third quarter
2005, as well as Farmer Mac's use of estimates and  assumptions  that affect the
amounts reported in the condensed  consolidated financial statements and related
notes for the periods presented,  see "Quantitative and Qualitative  Disclosures
About Market Risk Management--Credit Risk" below.

Results of Operations

     Overview.  Net income  available to common  stockholders  for third quarter
2005 was $7.6  million  or $0.67 per  diluted  common  share,  compared  to $8.6
million or $0.70 per diluted common share for third quarter 2004.  This decrease
was due  principally  to the  after-tax  effects  of the  $2.4  million  loss on
financial  derivatives  in third  quarter  2005  compared to gains on  financial
derivatives  of $5.3 million in third quarter 2004 and  partially  offset by the
release from the  allowance for losses during third quarter 2005 of $5.6 million
compared to provisions  for losses of $1.6 million during third quarter 2004. Of
the $5.6 million of the allowance  released in third quarter 2005,  $4.8 million
was related to a change in accounting  estimate.  Net income available to common
stockholders  for the nine months ended  September 30, 2005 was $20.8 million or
$1.80 per diluted  common share,  compared to $18.4 million or $1.50 per diluted
common share for the same period in 2004.

     As part of Farmer Mac's continuing evaluation of the overall credit quality
of its portfolio, the strong U.S. agricultural economy, the recent upward trends
in  agricultural  land  values,   the  reduction  in  Farmer  Mac's  outstanding
guarantees  and  commitments  and the  recordation  of a  change  in  accounting
estimate  resulting  from the  implementation  of a new  methodology to estimate
probable losses inherent in its post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I portfolio, Farmer Mac
determined  that the  appropriate  level of allowance for losses as of September
30, 2005 was $10.9 million.  This resulted in the release of approximately  $5.6
million from the  allowance  for losses in third  quarter  2005. Of that amount,
$4.8 million was to record a change in accounting estimate.  As of September 30,
2005, the allowance for losses was $10.9 million and 25 basis points relative to
the outstanding post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I portfolio,  compared to $17.1 million
and 37 basis  points as of  December  31,  2004 and $22.5  million  and 47 basis
points as of September 30, 2004.

     As of September 30, 2005, Farmer Mac's 90-day  delinquencies  (Farmer Mac I
loans  purchased or placed under  Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities  or LTSPCs
after  changes to Farmer  Mac's  statutory  charter in 1996 that were 90 days or
more past due, in foreclosure, restructured after delinquency, or in bankruptcy,
excluding  loans  performing  under  either  their  original  loan  terms  or  a
court-approved bankruptcy plan) were $40.6 million, representing 0.95 percent of
the  principal  balance of all loans  held and loans  underlying  post-1996  Act
Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities  and LTSPCs,  down from $47.6  million (1.01
percent) as of September 30, 2004.

      During third quarter 2005, Farmer Mac:

               o    added $91.8 million of Farmer Mac I loans under LTSPCs;
               o    purchased  $39.8  million of newly  originated  Farmer Mac I
                    loans; and
               o    purchased  $52.2  million of Farmer  Mac II  USDA-guaranteed
                    portions of loans.

As of September  30,  2005,  Farmer Mac's  outstanding  program  volume was $5.1
billion, which represented  approximately 11 percent of management's estimate of
a $47.8 billion market of eligible  agricultural  mortgage  loans.  Farmer Mac's
ongoing  guarantee and commitment fee income reflects the  annuity-like  revenue
stream of that aspect of the Corporation's  business.  That fee income is earned
on the  cumulative  outstanding  principal  balance  of  Farmer  Mac  Guaranteed
Securities and loans underlying  LTSPCs.  Accordingly,  guarantee and commitment
fees  increase  or  decrease  through  changes in  periodic  business  volume in
proportion to the change in that cumulative  outstanding  principal balance, not
in proportion to the change in periodic volume.

     Set forth below is a more  detailed  discussion  of Farmer Mac's results of
operations.

     Net Interest Income. Net interest income,  which does not include guarantee
fees for loans purchased prior to April 1, 2001 (the effective date of Statement
of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  140,  Accounting  for  Transfers  and
Servicing of Financial Assets and  Extinguishments of Liabilities ("SFAS 140")),
was $7.9 million for third  quarter  2005 and $23.8  million for the nine months
ended  September  30,  2005,   compared  to  $8.0  million  and  $25.3  million,
respectively,  for the same periods in 2004. The net interest yield was 84 basis
points for the nine months ended September 30, 2005, compared to 86 basis points
for the nine months ended  September  30,  2004.  The effect of SFAS 140 was the
classification of approximately  $2.8 million (10 basis points) of guarantee fee
income as interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2005, compared
to $3.2 million (11 basis points) for the nine months ended September 30, 2004.

     Farmer Mac  classifies  the net  interest  income and  expense  realized on
financial   derivatives   that  are  not  in  fair  value  or  cash  flow  hedge
relationships  as gains and losses on financial  derivatives and trading assets.
For the nine  months  ended  September  30, 2005 and 2004,  this  classification
resulted in the decrease of the net interest yield of 3 basis points and 5 basis
points, respectively.

     The net interest  yields for the nine months ended  September  30, 2005 and
2004 included the benefits of yield maintenance  payments of 12 basis points and
14 basis points, respectively.  Yield maintenance payments represent the present
value of expected  future interest income streams and accelerate the recognition
of interest  income from the  related  loans.  Because the timing and amounts of
these payments vary greatly,  variations do not necessarily indicate positive or
negative  trends to gauge future  financial  results.  For the nine months ended
September 30, 2005 and 2004,  the effects of yield  maintenance  payments on net
income and  diluted  earnings  per share were $2.2  million or $0.19 per diluted
share and $2.7 million or $0.22 per diluted share, respectively.

     The table below provides information regarding  interest-earning assets and
funding for the nine months ended  September  30, 2005 and 2004.  The balance of
non-accruing loans is included in the average balance of interest-earning  loans
presented, though no related income is included in the income figures presented.
Therefore, as the balance of non-accruing loans increases or decreases,  the net
interest yield will decrease or increase  accordingly.  Net interest  income and
the yield will also  fluctuate due to the  uncertainty of the timing and size of
yield maintenance payments.

     The low  average  rate  earned on cash and cash  equivalents  reflects  the
relatively  low level of  short-term  interest  rates in 2005 and  2004,  and an
increase in short-term market rates during the first three quarters of 2005. The
increase in the average rate for  investments  reflects the general  increase in
short-term  rates and the short-term or floating rate nature of most investments
acquired or reset during the first three quarters of 2005 and outstanding during
the first three  quarters of 2005.  The higher  average rate on loans and Farmer
Mac  Guaranteed  Securities  during the first nine months of 2005  reflects  the
increase in market  rates during the latter part of 2004 and first part of 2005,
which  affected  the rates on loans  acquired  or reset  during  that period and
outstanding  during the first nine months of 2005.  The average  rates on Farmer
Mac's notes payable due within one year are  consistent  with general  trends in
average short-term rates during the periods presented. The average rate on notes
payable  due  after  one year  reflects  the  retirement  of older  debt and the
issuance of new debt at higher relative rates during the first part of 2005.

     The  following  table sets forth  information  regarding the changes in the
components of Farmer Mac's net interest  income for the periods  indicated.  For
each  category,  information is provided on changes  attributable  to changes in
volume (change in volume  multiplied by old rate) and changes in rate (change in
rate  multiplied  by old  volume).  Combined  rate/volume  variances,  the third
element of the  calculation,  are allocated  based on their  relative  size. The
increases due to rate reflect the  short-term or  adjustable-rate  nature of the
assets or liabilities and the general increases in short-term market rates.

     Guarantee and  Commitment  Fees.  Guarantee and  commitment  fees were $4.8
million for third  quarter  2005 and $14.7  million  for the nine  months  ended
September 30, 2005,  compared to $5.3 million and $15.7  million,  respectively,
for the same  periods  in 2004.  The  effects of the  adoption  of SFAS 140 were
classification  as interest  income of guarantee  fees of $0.9 million for third
quarter  2005 and $2.8  million for the nine months  ended  September  30, 2005,
compared to $1.0 million and $3.2 million, respectively, for the same periods in
2004,  although  management  considers  the  amounts  to  have  been  earned  in
consideration  for the assumption of credit risk. That portion of the difference
or  "spread"  between  the cost of Farmer  Mac's debt  funding for loans and the
yield on  post-1996  Act Farmer Mac I  Guaranteed  Securities  held on its books
compensates  for credit  risk.  When a  post-1996  Act  Farmer Mac I  Guaranteed
Security is sold to a third party, Farmer Mac continues to receive the guarantee
fee component of that spread,  which continues to compensate  Farmer Mac for its
assumption  of credit  risk.  The  portion of the spread  that  compensates  for
interest rate risk would not typically  continue to be received by Farmer Mac if
the  asset  were  sold,  except  to the  extent  attributable  to  any  retained
interest-only strip.

     Expenses.  General and administrative  expenses were $2.6 million for third
quarter  2005 and $6.8  million for the nine months  ended  September  30, 2005,
compared to $2.0 million and $5.9 million, respectively, for the same periods in
2004.  Compensation  and employee  benefits  were $2.2 million for third quarter
2005 and $5.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2005,  compared to
$1.7  million  and $5.2  million,  respectively,  for the same  periods in 2004.
Regulatory  fees  assessed  by FCA for  third  quarter  2005 and 2004  were $0.6
million  and $0.5  million,  respectively.  Regulatory  fees for the nine months
ended  September  30, 2005 were $1.7  million,  compared to $1.6 million for the
nine months ended  September 30, 2004.  FCA's  regulatory fees charged to Farmer
Mac for the federal fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 were $2.0 million,  and
FCA has advised the  Corporation  that its estimated fees for the federal fiscal
year ended  September 30, 2005 will be $2.3 million.  After the end of a federal
government  fiscal year, FCA may revise its prior year estimated  assessments to
reflect actual costs incurred,  and has issued both  additional  assessments and
refunds in the past. Farmer Mac expects all of the above-mentioned  expenses and
regulatory fees to continue at or above current levels through 2006.

     During  third  quarter  2005,  Farmer Mac  released  $5.6  million from the
allowance  for losses,  compared to provisions of $1.6 million for third quarter
2004.  That  release  included  $4.8  million  that  resulted  from a change  in
accounting  estimate  related  to  the  implementation  of  a  new  process  for
estimating  losses  inherent  in  Farmer  Mac's  post-1996  Act  portfolio  to a
methodology that is based upon a model that reflects Farmer Mac's own historical
loss  experience and credit trends.  During the nine months ended  September 30,
2005,  Farmer Mac released $6.6 million from the allowance for losses,  compared
to provision of $4.8 million for the nine months ended  September 30, 2004.  See
"--Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Management--Credit
Risk" for additional  information  regarding  Farmer Mac's provision for losses,
provision for loan losses,  the change in  accounting  estimate and Farmer Mac's
new methodology  for  determining its allowance for losses.  As of September 30,
2005,  Farmer Mac's total  allowance for losses totaled $10.9  million,  or 0.25
percent of outstanding loans held or loans underlying post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I
Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs,  compared to $17.1 million and 0.37 percent as
of December 31, 2004.

     Gains and Losses on Financial  Derivatives and Trading Assets.  The loss on
financial derivatives and trading assets was $2.4 million for third quarter 2005
and $0.4 million for the nine months  ended  September  30, 2005,  compared to a
gain of $5.3  million and $2.4  million,  respectively,  for the same periods in
2004.  The  losses  in  2005  and the  gains  in 2004  resulted  primarily  from
fluctuations  in  the  fair  values  of  financial  derivatives  that  were  not
designated  as either fair value hedges or cash flow hedges in  accordance  with
SFAS 133, which fluctuations resulted from movements in interest rates.

     Non-GAAP Performance Measures.  Farmer Mac reports its financial results in
accordance with GAAP. In addition to GAAP measures,  Farmer Mac presents certain
non-GAAP  performance  measures.  Farmer  Mac uses  these  non-GAAP  performance
measures to develop financial plans, to measure corporate economic  performance,
and to set incentive  compensation  because,  in management's view, the non-GAAP
measures  provide a more  meaningful  representation  of Farmer  Mac's  economic
performance,  transaction  economics  and  business  trends.  Investors  and the
investment  analyst  community have previously  relied upon similar  measures to
evaluate  performance  and issue  projections.  These non-GAAP  disclosures  are
intended to supplement, not replace, GAAP information.

     Farmer Mac developed  non-GAAP core earnings to present net income less the
after-tax effects of SFAS 133. Core earnings for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2005 were $9.3 million and $21.5 million,  respectively,  compared
to $5.4 million and $17.5 million for the three and nine months ended  September
30, 2004. The reconciliation of GAAP net income available to common stockholders
to core earnings is presented in the following table:

     Business  Volume.  New  business  volume for third  quarter 2005 was $183.8
million,  up from $161.9  million in second  quarter 2005 and $157.1  million in
third quarter 2004. Farmer Mac's new business with agricultural mortgage lenders
continues to be constrained by:

     o    high  levels  of  available  capital  and  liquidity  of  agricultural
          lenders;
     o    alternative sources of funding and credit enhancement for agricultural
          lenders;
     o    increased   competition  in  the  secondary  market  for  agricultural
          mortgage loans;
     o    reduced growth rates in the agricultural  mortgage market, due largely
          to the strong liquidity of many farmers and ranchers; and
     o    the lower rate of growth of the Farm Credit System mortgage portfolio,
          reducing the demand for LTSPCs.

     For a more detailed discussion of the above factors and the related effects
on Farmer Mac's business volume,  see  "Management's  Discussion and Analysis of
Financial  Condition  and  Results  of  Operations--Outlook  for  2005"  in  the
Corporation's  Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended  December 31, 2004,
filed with the SEC on March 16, 2005.

     Looking  ahead,  Farmer  Mac is  developing  innovative  ways to serve  the
financing needs of rural America,  and remains  confident of  opportunities  for
increased  business  volume and income  growth as a result of the  Corporation's
product development and customer service efforts. In third quarter 2005:

     o    Farmer Mac agreed to  purchase  or issue  LTSPCs for loans  secured by
          agricultural   storage   and   processing    facilities    aggregating
          approximately   $32.0  million,   primarily  for  ethanol   processing
          facilities.  As of September 30, 2005,  approximately  $7.4 million of
          those loans were not yet disbursed by the lender,  though those events
          are expected to occur during fourth quarter 2005.
     o    Farmer  Mac  entered  into  an  alliance  with  the  American  Bankers
          Association, finalized October 31, 2005, under which Farmer Mac agreed
          to  provide  efficient  access  and  improved  pricing  to ABA  member
          institutions and the ABA agreed to promote member participation in the
          Farmer Mac I loan purchase program.
     o    Farmer Mac's satellite credit underwriting office in Ames, Iowa became
          fully  functional.  This office  facilitates  the use of Farmer Mac by
          Midwestern  agricultural  lenders,  and Farmer Mac's responsiveness to
          them.
     o    Farmer Mac purchased  $500 million of three-year  secured notes issued
          by  the  National  Rural  Utilities  Cooperative  Finance  Corporation
          ("CFC"). The notes, which are mission-related, non-program investments
          that  comply  with  parameters  established  by FCA,  are  secured  by
          mortgage indebtedness issued by CFC-member rural electric distribution
          cooperatives serving communities across rural America. The transaction
          provided  CFC with a new  source of  liquidity  for its rural  utility
          cooperative   members  that  serve  rural   communities   and  support
          agriculture in 47 states,  and advances Farmer Mac's financial role in
          and commitment to rural America.

Farmer  Mac has  diversified  its  marketing  focus  to  include  large  program
transactions that emphasize high asset quality,  with greater protection against
adverse  credit  performance  and  commensurately  lower  compensation  for  the
assumption  of credit  risk and  administrative  costs,  resulting  in  marginal
returns  on equity  equal to or better  than the  current  net return on equity.
Management   expects  those   transactions   to  enhance  Farmer  Mac's  mission
accomplishment and net income.

     The  following  tables  set forth the amount of all Farmer Mac I and Farmer
Mac II loan purchase and guarantee  activities for newly  originated and current
seasoned loans during the periods indicated.

     The  weighted-average  age of the Farmer Mac I newly originated and current
seasoned  loans  purchased  during third quarter 2005 and third quarter 2004 was
less than one month. Of the Farmer Mac I newly  originated and current  seasoned
loans purchased during third quarter 2005 and third quarter 2004, 50 percent and
45 percent,  respectively,  had principal  amortization  periods longer than the
maturity   date,   resulting   in  balloon   payments   at   maturity,   with  a
weighted-average  remaining  term to  maturity  of 14.6  years  and 15.2  years,
respectively.  The  weighted-average  age of delinquent  loans  purchased out of
securitized  pools and LTSPCs  during third  quarter 2005 and third quarter 2004
was 5.7 years and 4.7 years, respectively.

      As of  September  30, 2005,  more  than 300  lenders  were  participating,
directly  or  indirectly,  in one or both of the  Farmer  Mac I or Farmer Mac II
programs,  including  116  approved  loan  sellers  in the  Farmer Mac I program
ranging from  single-office  to multi-branch  institutions,  spanning  community
banks, Farm Credit System institutions, mortgage companies, commercial banks and
insurance  companies.  The reduction in the number of approved loan sellers from
157 as of December  31, 2004 is  principally  the result of  decertification  by
Farmer Mac of  inactive  sellers  during  second  quarter  2005.  In addition to
participating  directly in the Farmer Mac I program,  some of the approved  loan
sellers  enable  other  lenders to  participate  indirectly  in the Farmer Mac I
program by managing  correspondent  networks of lenders from which they purchase
loans to sell to Farmer Mac. As of September 30, 2005,  approximately 75 lenders
were participating in those networks.

     Any lender  authorized by the USDA to obtain a USDA guarantee on a loan may
be a seller in the Farmer Mac II program.  As of September 30, 2005,  there were
137 active sellers in the Farmer Mac II program,  compared to 133 as of December
31, 2004.  Sellers in the Farmer Mac II program  consist mostly of community and
regional banks.

     USDA's most  recent  publications  (as  available  on USDA's  website as of
October 24, 2005) forecast:

     o    2005 net cash farm income to be $85.2 billion, declining less than one
          percent following a record year of $85.5 billion in 2004 and exceeding
          the 2003 level of $71.6 billion;
     o    2005 net farm income to be $71.8 billion, which is a decrease of $10.7
          billion from the record $82.5 billion  income for 2004 but still $19.4
          million higher than the 10-year average net farm income;
     o    Total  direct  government  payments  to be $21.4  billion in 2005,  an
          increase  from the 2004 payments of $13.3  billion.  Market prices for
          crops affect payment rates for  countercyclical  government  programs.
          Under countercyclical  programs the level of payments varies inversely
          with market prices;  USDA anticipates  program crop prices to be lower
          in 2005,  due in part to large  inventories  from 2003 and 2004 bumper
          crops;
     o    The value of U.S.  farm real estate to increase 7.3 percent in 2005 to
          $1.32 trillion, a smaller increase as compared to the 2004 increase of
          10.4 percent. USDA is anticipating  improvement in the general economy
          to support further growth in farmland values; and
     o    The amount of farm real estate debt to increase by 4.3 percent in 2005
          to $119.2 billion, compared to $114.3 billion in 2004.


     The USDA forecast  components  referenced above relate to U.S.  agriculture
generally, but should be favorable for Farmer Mac's financial condition relative
to its exposure to  outstanding  guarantees  and  commitments,  as they indicate
strong  borrower cash flows,  and generally  increased  values in U.S. farm real
estate.

Balance Sheet Review

     During the nine months ended September 30, 2005,  there were $131.7 million
of net principal  paydowns in program assets  (Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities
and  loans)  and a  $544.8  million  increase  in the  portfolio  of  investment
securities and cash and cash  equivalents.  Consistent  with the net increase in
assets  during the period,  total  liabilities  increased  $409.7  million  from
December 31, 2004 to September 30, 2005. The increase in assets and  liabilities
was due  principally  to the purchase and funding of $500 million of  three-year
CFC secured notes. For further information  regarding  off-balance sheet program
activities, see "--Off-Balance Sheet Program Activities" below.

     During  the  nine  months  ended  September  30,  2005,  accumulated  other
comprehensive income/(loss) decreased $1.8 million, which is the net effect of a
$17.1 million decrease in after-tax unrealized gains on securities available for
sale and a $15.2  million  increase  in the  after-tax  fair value of  financial
derivatives  classified  as cash flow hedges.  Accumulated  other  comprehensive
income/(loss)  is not a component  of Farmer  Mac's core  capital or  regulatory
capital.

     As of September 30, 2005, Farmer Mac's core capital totaled $240.2 million,
compared to $237.7  million as of December 31, 2004.  As of September  30, 2005,
core capital  exceeded  Farmer Mac's statutory  minimum  capital  requirement of
$139.1 million by $101.1 million.

     Farmer Mac was in compliance  with its risk-based  capital  standards as of
September 30, 2005. As of September 30, 2005, the risk-based capital stress test
generated a  regulatory  capital  requirement  of $45.6  million.  Farmer  Mac's
regulatory  capital of $251.1  million as of September  30, 2005  exceeded  that
amount by approximately  $205.5 million.  The increase in the risk-based capital
requirement  from December 31, 2004 ($37.1 million) to September 30, 2005 ($45.6
million) was a result of changes in the interest rate environment. Farmer Mac is
required  to  hold  capital  at the  higher  of the  statutory  minimum  capital
requirement or the amount required by the risk-based capital stress test.

     At its October 13, 2005  meeting,  the FCA Board  approved a proposed  rule
that would revise  certain FCA  regulations  governing  the  risk-based  capital
stress test  applicable to Farmer Mac. FCA announced that the proposed rule will
be published in the Federal Register for a 90-day comment period. As of November
9, 2005, that publication had not occurred.  FCA's  announcement of the proposed
rule  stated that it "is  designed to update  Farmer  Mac's  risk-based  capital
stress test to reflect the evolution of the Corporation's loan portfolio and the
practices of other leading  financial  institutions.  The FCA Board is currently
scheduled to consider a final rule for the Farmer Mac risk-based  capital stress
test in September  2006." See  "Regulatory  Matters" for additional  information
regarding the proposed rule.

Off-Balance Sheet Program Activities

     Farmer Mac offers  approved  agricultural  and rural  residential  mortgage
lenders two  off-balance  sheet  alternatives  to increase  their  liquidity  or
lending  capacity  while  retaining the cash flow  benefits of their loans:  (1)
Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities,  which are available through either the Farmer
Mac I program or the Farmer Mac II program,  and (2) LTSPCs, which are available
only  through  the Farmer Mac I program.  Both of these  alternatives  result in
off-balance  sheet  transactions  for Farmer  Mac.  See Note 3 to the  condensed
consolidated financial statements for further information regarding Farmer Mac's
off-balance sheet program activities.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Management

     Interest  Rate Risk.  Farmer Mac is  subject to  interest  rate risk on all
assets held for investment  because of possible  timing  differences in the cash
flows of the assets and related  liabilities.  This risk is primarily related to
loans held and on-balance sheet Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities because of the
ability of borrowers to prepay their mortgages before the scheduled  maturities,
thereby  increasing the risk of asset and liability cash flow  mismatches.  Cash
flow mismatches in a changing  interest rate environment can reduce the earnings
of the  Corporation  if assets repay sooner than expected and the resulting cash
flows must be reinvested in lower-yielding investments when Farmer Mac's funding
costs  cannot be  correspondingly  reduced,  or if assets repay more slowly than
expected and the associated debt must be replaced by higher-cost debt.

     Yield maintenance  provisions and other prepayment  penalties  contained in
many agricultural  mortgage loans reduce, but do not eliminate,  this prepayment
risk,  particularly in the case of a defaulted loan where yield  maintenance may
not be  collected.  Those  provisions  require  borrowers to make an  additional
payment when they prepay their loans so that,  when  reinvested with the prepaid
principal, yield maintenance payments generate substantially the same cash flows
that would have been generated had the loan not prepaid. Those provisions create
a disincentive  to prepayment and  compensate the  Corporation  for its interest
rate  risks to a large  degree.  As of  September  30,  2005,  57 percent of the
outstanding  balance of all loans  held and loans  underlying  on-balance  sheet
Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities (including 81 percent of all loans with fixed
interest  rates)  were  covered  by  yield  maintenance   provisions  and  other
prepayment  penalties.  Of the  Farmer  Mac I new and  current  fixed rate loans
purchased in third quarter 2005,  none had yield  maintenance or another form of
prepayment  protection.  As of September 30, 2005,  none of the  USDA-guaranteed
portions  underlying  Farmer Mac II Guaranteed  Securities had yield maintenance
provisions;   however,  16  percent  contained  prepayment  penalties.   Of  the
USDA-guaranteed  portions  purchased in third quarter 2005, 24 percent contained
prepayment penalties.

     As of September  30, 2005,  Farmer Mac had $437.6  million of cash and cash
equivalents  and $1.6 billion of investment  securities.  Cash  equivalents  and
investment securities pose only limited interest rate risk to Farmer Mac, due to
their closely matched funding. Farmer Mac's cash equivalents mature within three
months and are match-funded with discount notes having similar maturities. As of
September  30, 2005,  Farmer  Mac's  investment  securities  consisted of $760.2
million of floating rate securities that have rates that adjust within one year.
These floating rate investments are funded using:

     o    a series of discount note issuances in which each successive  discount
          note is issued and matures on or about the corresponding interest rate
          reset date of the related investment;
     o    floating-rate  notes  having  similar  rate  reset  provisions  as the
          related investment; or
     o    fixed-rate  notes  swapped to  floating  rates  having  similar  reset
          provisions as the related investment.

     The most  comprehensive  stress test of Farmer Mac's  exposure to long-term
interest rate risk is the  sensitivity  of its Market Value of Equity ("MVE") to
yield curve shocks.  MVE  represents  the present value of all future cash flows
from on- and off-balance  sheet assets,  liabilities and financial  derivatives,
discounted  at  current  interest  rates and  spreads.  The  following  schedule
summarizes the results of Farmer Mac's MVE sensitivity  analysis as of September
30, 2005 and December 31, 2004 to an immediate and instantaneous  parallel shift
in the yield curve.

</TABLE>

     During third  quarter 2005,  Farmer Mac  maintained a low level of interest
rate sensitivity through ongoing asset and liability management  activities.  As
of  September  30, 2005,  a uniform or  "parallel"  increase of 100 basis points
would have increased  NII, a shorter-term  measure of interest rate risk, by 1.4
percent,  while a parallel decrease of 100 basis points would have decreased NII
by 0.4 percent.  Farmer Mac also measures the sensitivity of both MVE and NII to
a variety  of  non-parallel  interest  rate  shocks,  including  flattening  and
steepening  yield curve  scenarios.  As of September 30, 2005,  both MVE and NII
showed similar or lesser  sensitivity to non-parallel  shocks as to the parallel
shocks. As of September 30, 2005,  Farmer Mac's effective  duration gap, another
standard measure of interest rate risk that measures the difference  between the
sensitivities  of assets compared to that of  liabilities,  was plus 1.3 months,
compared to plus 0.4 months as of December 31, 2004.  Duration matching helps to
maintain the correlation of cash flows and stable  portfolio  earnings even when
interest rates are not stable.  The relative  insensitivity  of Farmer Mac's MVE
and NII to both parallel and non-parallel interest rate shocks, and its duration
gap, indicate the  effectiveness of the  Corporation's  approach to managing its
interest rate risk exposures.

     As of September  30, 2005,  Farmer Mac had $1.3 billion  combined  notional
amount of interest  rate swaps with terms  ranging from 1 to 15 years.  Of those
interest rate swaps,  $629.6 million were  floating-to-fixed  rate interest rate
swaps,  $205.0  million were  fixed-to-floating  interest  rate swaps and $506.2
million were basis swaps.

     Farmer Mac uses financial  derivatives as an end-user for hedging purposes,
not for trading or speculative  purposes.  When financial  derivatives  meet the
specific  hedge  criteria  under SFAS 133, they are accounted for as either fair
value  hedges or cash flow  hedges.  Financial  derivatives  that do not satisfy
those hedge  criteria  are not  accounted  for as hedges and changes in the fair
value of those financial derivatives are reported as a gain or loss on financial
derivatives and trading assets in the consolidated statements of operations. All
of Farmer Mac's financial  derivative  transactions are conducted under standard
collateralized  agreements that limit Farmer Mac's potential  credit exposure to
any counterparty.  As of September 30, 2005, Farmer Mac had no  uncollateralized
net exposure to any counterparty.

     Credit Risk.  Farmer Mac's  primary  exposure to credit risk is the risk of
loss  resulting  from the  inability of  borrowers  to repay their  mortgages in
conjunction  with a deficiency  in the value of the  collateral  relative to the
amount outstanding on the mortgage and the costs of liquidation.  Farmer Mac has
established underwriting, appraisal and documentation standards for Farmer Mac I
agricultural  mortgage loans to mitigate the risk of loss from borrower defaults
and to provide guidance concerning the management, administration and conduct of
underwriting and appraisals to all  participating  sellers and potential sellers
in its programs.

     Farmer Mac's  allowance for losses is presented in three  components on its
consolidated balance sheet:

     o    an "Allowance for loan losses" on loans held for investment;
     o    a valuation  allowance on real estate owned,  which is included in the
          balance sheet under "Real estate owned, net of valuation allowance";
     o    an allowance for losses on loans underlying post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I
          Guaranteed  Securities  and  LTSPCs,  which is included in the balance
          sheet under "Reserve for losses."

     Farmer Mac's  provision  for losses is presented in two  components  on its
consolidated statement of operations:

     o    a "Provision for loan losses," which represents losses on Farmer Mac's
          loans held for investment; and
     o    a "Provision for losses," which represents  losses on loans underlying
          post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities  and LTSPCs and real
          estate owned.

     Historically,  Farmer Mac  estimated  probable  losses  using a  systematic
process that began with management's  evaluation of the results of a proprietary
loan pool  simulation and guarantee fee model.  That model drew upon  historical
information  from a data set of agricultural  mortgage loans screened to include
only those  loans with  credit  characteristics  similar to those  eligible  for
Farmer Mac's programs.  The results  generated by that model were then modified,
as necessary, by the application of management's judgment.

     During third  quarter 2005,  Farmer Mac completed the planned  migration of
its  methodology for determining its allowance for losses away from one based on
its loan  pool  simulation  and  guarantee  fee  model  to one  based on its own
historical portfolio loss experience and credit trends.  Farmer Mac recorded the
effects of that change as a change in  accounting  estimate as of September  30,
2005.

     Farmer Mac's new  methodology  for  determining  its  allowance  for losses
incorporates the Corporation's proprietary automated loan classification system.
That  system  scores  loans  based  on  criteria  such as  historical  repayment
performance, loan seasoning, loan size and loan-to-value ratio. For the purposes
of the loss allowance methodology,  the loans in Farmer Mac's portfolio of loans
and loans underlying post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs
have been scored and  classified  for each calendar  quarter since first quarter
2000. The new allowance methodology captures the migration of loan scores across
concurrent  and  overlapping  3-year time  horizons  and  calculates  loss rates
separately within each loan classification for loans underlying LTSPCs and loans
and loans  underlying  post-1996  Act Farmer Mac I  Guaranteed  Securities.  The
calculated loss rates are applied to the current classification  distribution of
Farmer Mac's portfolio to estimate  inherent losses,  on the assumption that the
historical  credit losses and trends used to calculate  loss rates will continue
in the future. Management evaluates this assumption by taking into consideration
several factors, including:

     o    economic conditions;
     o    geographic and agricultural  commodity/product  concentrations  in the
          portfolio;
     o    the credit profile of the portfolio;
     o    delinquency trends of the portfolio; and
     o    historical charge-off and recovery activities of the portfolio.

If, based on that  evaluation,  management  concludes that the assumption is not
valid,  the loss  allowance  calculation  is modified by the addition of further
assumptions to capture current portfolio trends and characteristics  that differ
from historical experience.

     As of September 30, 2005,  Farmer Mac concluded  that the credit profile of
the portfolio was  consistent  with Farmer Mac's  historical  credit profile and
trends.

     In establishing  its allowance for losses as of September 30, 2005,  Farmer
Mac  assessed  the  impact of  hurricanes  Katrina  and Rita on its loans in the
affected regions of Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi. Farmer Mac modeled various
stress  tests on the  performance  and  collateral  values of those  assets  and
determined  that any effect on its allowance for losses as of September 30, 2005
was nominal.  Farmer Mac will  continue to monitor the loans in its portfolio in
that  region,  as well as loans in its  portfolio  in the  regions  affected  by
hurricane  Wilma,  and  assess  any  impact on the  allowance  for losses as new
information becomes available.

     Management  believes  that  the  allowance  for  losses  adequately  covers
probable   losses  inherent  in  its  portfolio  under  Statement  of  Financial
Accounting  Standards  No.  5,  Accounting  for  Contingencies  ("SFAS  5")  and
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 114, Accounting by Creditors for
Impairment of a Loan, as amended ("SFAS 114").

Mac's  allowance  for losses for the three and nine months ended  September  30,
2005 and 2004:

     During  third  quarter  2005,  Farmer Mac  released  $5.6  million from the
allowance  for losses.  Of that  amount,  $4.8 million was to record a change in
accounting  estimate.  During third quarter 2004, Farmer Mac recorded provisions
for losses of $1.6 million.  During third  quarter 2005,  Farmer Mac charged off
$0.1 million in losses  against the allowance for losses and had $0.5 million in
recoveries for net recoveries of $0.4 million. During third quarter 2004, Farmer
Mac charged off $1.1 million in losses  against the allowance for losses and had
$0.1 million in recoveries  for net  charge-offs  of $1.0 million.  There was no
previously  accrued or  advanced  interest  on loans or Farmer Mac I  Guaranteed
Securities  that was charged off in third quarter 2005 or third quarter 2004. As
of September 30, 2005,  Farmer Mac's allowance for losses totaled $10.9 million,
or 25 basis points of the outstanding  principal balance of loans held and loans
underlying post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs, compared
to $17.1 million (37 basis points) as of December 31, 2004.

     As of September 30, 2005, Farmer Mac's 90-day  delinquencies  totaled $40.6
million and represented 0.95 percent of the principal  balance of all loans held
and loans  underlying  post-1996  Act Farmer  Mac I  Guaranteed  Securities  and
LTSPCs, compared to $47.6 million (1.01 percent) as of September 30, 2004. As of
September 30, 2005,  Farmer Mac's  non-performing  assets (which includes 90-day
delinquencies,  loans  performing  under either their  original  loan terms or a
court-approved bankruptcy plan, and real estate owned) totaled $64.2 million and
represented  1.50 percent of the  principal  balance of all loans held and loans
underlying post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs, compared
to $75.0 million (1.58  percent) as of September 30, 2004.  Loans that have been
restructured  after  delinquency were  insignificant and are included within the
reported 90-day delinquency and non-performing  asset disclosures.  From quarter
to quarter,  Farmer Mac anticipates that 90-day delinquencies and non-performing
assets will  fluctuate,  both in dollars and as a percentage of the  outstanding
portfolio,  with higher levels likely at the end of the first and third quarters
of each year corresponding to the semi-annual (January 1st and July 1st) payment
characteristics of most Farmer Mac I loans.

     The following table presents historical  information regarding Farmer Mac's
non-performing assets and 90-day delinquencies:

     As of September  30, 2005,  approximately  $1.2 billion  (28.4  percent) of
Farmer Mac's  outstanding  loans held and loans underlying  post-1996 Act Farmer
Mac I  Guaranteed  Securities  and  LTSPCs  were in their peak  delinquency  and
default  years  (approximately  years  three  through  five after  origination),
compared to $1.8 billion (31.0 percent) of such loans as of September 30, 2004.

     As of September 30, 2005, Farmer Mac individually analyzed $47.3 million of
its $94.8 million of impaired assets for collateral  shortfalls  against updated
appraised  values,  other updated  collateral  valuations or discounted  values.
Farmer Mac evaluated the  remaining  $47.5 million of impaired  assets for which
updated valuations were not available in the aggregate in consideration of their
similar risk characteristics and historical statistics.  Of the $47.3 million of
assets  analyzed,  $42.5 million were  adequately  collateralized.  For the $4.8
million of assets that were not adequately collateralized, individual collateral
shortfalls  totaled $0.5  million.  Accordingly,  Farmer Mac  recorded  specific
allowances of $0.5 million for those under-collateralized assets as of September
30, 2005.  As of  September  30,  2005,  in addition to the specific  allowances
provided,  Farmer  Mac  recorded  non-specific  or general  allowances  of $10.4
million, bringing the total allowance for losses to $10.9 million.

     As of  September  30, 2005,  the  weighted-average  original  loan-to-value
("LTV") ratio for all loans held and loans underlying post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I
Guaranteed  Securities  and  LTSPCs  was 50  percent,  and the  weighted-average
original LTV ratio for all post-1996 Act non-performing assets was 57 percent.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

     Farmer Mac has  sufficient  liquidity and capital  resources to support its
operations  for the next twelve  months and has a  contingency  funding  plan to
handle unanticipated disruptions in its access to the capital markets.

     Debt Issuance.  Section 8.6(e) of Farmer Mac's statutory charter (12 U.S.C.
ss.  2279aa-6(e))  authorizes  Farmer Mac to issue debt  obligations to purchase
eligible  mortgage  loans and Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities and to maintain
reasonable amounts for business operations, including adequate liquidity. Farmer
Mac funds its  program  operations  primarily  by issuing  debt  obligations  of
various maturities in the public capital markets.  Farmer Mac's debt obligations
consist of discount notes and medium-term notes,  including floating rate notes,
issued to obtain funds  principally to cover the costs of purchasing and holding
loans and securities  (including Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities).  Farmer Mac
also issues discount notes and medium-term  notes to obtain funds to finance its
investments, transaction costs, guarantee payments and LTSPC payments.

     The interest and  principal on Farmer Mac's debt are not  guaranteed by and
do not constitute debts or obligations of FCA or the United States or any agency
or  instrumentality of the United States other than Farmer Mac. Farmer Mac is an
institution  of the  Farm  Credit  System,  but is not  liable  for any  debt or
obligation of any other institution of the Farm Credit System. Likewise, neither
the Farm Credit System nor any other  individual  institution of the Farm Credit
System  is  liable  for any debt or  obligation  of  Farmer  Mac.  Income to the
purchaser of a Farmer Mac discount note or medium-term  note is not exempt under
federal law from federal,  state or local taxation.  The Corporation's  discount
notes and medium-term  notes are not currently rated by a nationally  recognized
statistical rating organization.

     Farmer Mac's board of directors has  authorized  the issuance of up to $5.0
billion of  discount  notes and  medium-term  notes (of which $3.9  billion  was
outstanding  as of  September  30,  2005),  subject  to  periodic  review of the
adequacy of that level relative to Farmer Mac's borrowing  requirements.  Farmer
Mac  invests the  proceeds of such  issuances  in loans,  Farmer Mac  Guaranteed
Securities  and  non-program  investment  assets in accordance  with  guidelines
established  by its board of  directors in  compliance  with the  liquidity  and
investment regulation recently adopted by FCA. See "Regulatory Matters."

     In third  quarter  2005,  Farmer Mac  conducted a global  debt  offering to
facilitate the funding of business growth  opportunities and issued $500 million
of three-year fixed rate notes under the program.  That issue of notes is listed
on the New York Stock  Exchange.  Farmer Mac is  applying  to list notes  issued
under its global debt program on the London Stock Exchange.

     Liquidity.  The  funding  and  liquidity  needs of  Farmer  Mac's  business
programs are driven by the purchase and  retention of eligible  loans and Farmer
Mac  Guaranteed  Securities,  the  maturities of Farmer Mac's discount notes and
medium-term notes and payment of principal and interest on Farmer Mac Guaranteed
Securities. Farmer Mac's primary sources of funds to meet these needs are:

     o    principal and interest  payments and ongoing  guarantee and commitment
          fees received on loans, Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs;
     o    principal and interest payments  received from investment  securities;
          and
     o    the issuance of new discount notes and medium-term notes.

     As a result  of  Farmer  Mac's  regular  issuance  of  discount  notes  and
medium-term notes and its status as a federally chartered instrumentality of the
United  States,  Farmer  Mac has been  able to access  the  capital  markets  at
favorable rates. Farmer Mac has also used floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps,
combined with discount note issuances,  as a source of fixed-rate funding. While
the swap market may provide  favorable  fixed rates,  swap  transactions  expose
Farmer Mac to the risk of future  widening of its own  issuance  spreads  versus
corresponding  LIBOR rates. If the spreads on the Farmer Mac discount notes were
to  increase  relative to LIBOR,  Farmer Mac would be exposed to a  commensurate
reduction   on  its  net  interest   yield  on  the   notional   amount  of  its
floating-to-fixed  interest  rate  swaps and  other  LIBOR-based  floating  rate
assets.

     Farmer Mac maintains  cash and liquidity  investments  in cash  equivalents
(including  commercial paper and other short-term money market  instruments) and
investment  securities  that  can be  drawn  upon  for  liquidity  needs.  As of
September  30,  2005,  Farmer  Mac's  cash and cash  equivalents  and  liquidity
investment  securities  were $437.6 million and $1.1 billion,  respectively.  In
addition,  as of  September  30,  2005,  Farmer Mac held:  1) $500.0  million of
mission-related  non-program  investments issued by the National Rural Utilities
Cooperative  Finance  Corporation,  and  2)  $769.6  million  of  Farmer  Mac II
Guaranteed  Securities  backed by  USDA-guaranteed  portions that carry the full
faith and credit of the U.S. Government. As of September 30, 2005, the aggregate
of  the  Farmer  Mac  II  Guaranteed  Securities,   mission-related  non-program
investments,  cash and  liquidity  investments  represented  70 percent of total
liabilities.  Farmer  Mac has a policy of  maintaining  a minimum  of 60 days of
liquidity and a target of 90 days of liquidity.  For third quarter 2005,  Farmer
Mac maintained an average of greater than 90 days of liquidity.

     Capital.  During third quarter 2005, Farmer Mac repurchased  191,810 shares
of its Class C Non-Voting  Common Stock at an average  price of $24.56 per share
pursuant to the  Corporation's  previously  announced stock repurchase  program.
These  repurchases  reduced  the  Corporation's  capital by  approximately  $4.7
million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2005, Farmer Mac repurchased
756,252  shares of its Class C Non-Voting  Common  Stock at an average  price of
$20.70, which reduced the Corporation's capital by approximately $15.7 million.

Regulatory Matters

     On  September  30,  2005,  the final  regulation  relating to Farmer  Mac's
investments  and  liquidity  became  effective.  FCA  included  several  of  the
revisions to the proposed regulation  suggested by Farmer Mac in comments to the
proposal  and Farmer Mac  expects to be able to comply  with the  regulation  in
accordance  with the  timeframes  established in the  regulation.  Farmer Mac is
required to comply with the liquidity  provisions of the regulation by September
30, 2007.

     At its October 13, 2005  meeting,  the FCA Board  approved a proposed  rule
that would revise certain FCA regulations  governing the risk-based capital test
applicable to Farmer Mac. FCA announced that the proposed rule will be published
in the Federal  Register for a 90-day  comment  period.  As of November 9, 2005,
that  publication  had not  occurred.  FCA's  announcement  of the proposed rule
stated that it "is designed to update  Farmer Mac's  risk-based  capital  stress
test to reflect  the  evolution  of the  Corporation's  loan  portfolio  and the
practices of other leading  financial  institutions.  The FCA Board is currently
scheduled to consider a final rule for the Farmer Mac risk-based  capital stress
test in  September  2006."  Farmer Mac has not  completed  its  analysis  of the
proposed rule,  but believes that the proposal,  if adopted in its proposed form
and  under  current  economic  conditions  and the  state  of the  Corporation's
portfolio,  would increase the Corporation's risk-based capital requirement from
the current level to a higher level that would be close to the statutory minimum
capital  requirement.  In that regard,  FCA has estimated that, had the proposed
rule been effective at the time, the risk-based  capital  requirement as of June
30,  2005  would  have  been  $123.5  million,  compared  to the  $49.6  million
risk-based capital requirement under the current risk-based capital stress test.
As of that date, Farmer Mac's regulatory capital was $254.3 million.  As part of
the formal rule-making process,  Farmer Mac will provide written comments on the
proposed regulation to FCA within the public comment period.

Other Matters

     In fourth quarter 2004 and each of the first three quarters of 2005, Farmer
Mac paid a  quarterly  dividend  of $0.10 per share on the  Corporation's  three
classes of common stock - Class A Voting  Common  Stock,  Class B Voting  Common
Stock, and Class C Non-Voting  Common Stock.  Each dividend was paid on the last
day of each  quarter  to  holders  of  record as of the 15th day of the month in
which the dividend was paid. On October 6, 2005, Farmer Mac's board of directors
declared a  quarterly  dividend  of $0.10 per share on the  Corporation's  three
classes of common stock  payable on December 30, 2005 to holders of record as of
December 15, 2005.  Farmer Mac expects to continue to pay  comparable  quarterly
cash dividends for the foreseeable future,  subject to the outlook and indicated
capital  needs  of  the  Corporation  and  the  determination  of the  board  of
directors. Farmer Mac's ability to declare and pay dividends could be restricted
if it  were  to  fail  to  comply  with  regulatory  capital  requirements.  See
"Business--Government     Regulation    of    Farmer    Mac--Regulation--Capital
Standards--Enforcement  levels" in Farmer Mac's  Annual  Report on Form 10-K for
the fiscal year ended  December 31, 2004.  Farmer Mac's ability to pay dividends
on its  common  stock  is  also  subject  to the  payment  of  dividends  on its
outstanding preferred stock.

     Farmer  Mac  announced  in  August  2004 that its  board of  directors  had
authorized a program to repurchase up to 10 percent, or 1,055,500 shares, of the
Corporation's  outstanding Class C Non-Voting Common Stock. During third quarter
2005,  the  aggregate  number of shares  repurchased  by Farmer Mac  reached the
maximum number  authorized  under the program,  thereby  terminating the program
according to its terms.  Farmer  Mac's board has  authorized  the board  finance
committee  to evaluate  and  implement a new  program to  repurchase  additional
shares of Class C Non-Voting Common Stock.

disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information  required
to be disclosed  in the  Corporation's  periodic  filings  under the  Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"),  including this report,  is recorded,
processed,  summarized and reported on a timely basis. These disclosure controls
and  procedures  include  controls  and  procedures   designed  to  ensure  that
information  required to be disclosed  under the Exchange Act is accumulated and
communicated  to  the  Corporation's  management  on a  timely  basis  to  allow
decisions  regarding required  disclosure.  Farmer Mac's Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial  Officer have evaluated the  effectiveness of the design and
operation of the  Corporation's  disclosure  controls and procedures (as defined
under Rules  13a-15(e)  and  15d-15(e) of the Exchange  Act) as of September 30,
2005. Based upon that evaluation, Farmer Mac's Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer have concluded that the Corporation's  disclosure controls and
procedures are adequate and effective.

     Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. There were no changes
in Farmer Mac's  internal  control over financial  reporting  during the quarter
ended September 30, 2005 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
to materially affect, Farmer Mac's internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1. Legal Proceedings

        Farmer Mac is not a party to any material pending legal proceedings.

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds


          (a)  Farmer Mac is a federally chartered instrumentality of the United
               States and its Common Stock is exempt from registration  pursuant
               to Section 3(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933.

               On July 6, 2005,  pursuant to Farmer  Mac's  policy that  permits
               directors  of Farmer  Mac to elect to  receive  shares of Class C
               Non-Voting  Common Stock in lieu of their annual cash  retainers,
               Farmer  Mac  issued  an  aggregate  of 669  shares of its Class C
               Non-Voting  Common Stock,  at an issue price of $22.05 per share,
               to the eight  directors who elected to receive such stock in lieu
               of their cash retainers.

               On September 30, 2005,  Farmer Mac granted options under its 1997
               Stock Option Plan to purchase an  aggregate  of 46,000  shares of
               Class C Non-Voting  Common Stock, an exercise price of $24.34 per
               share,   to   twenty-one   non-officer   employees  as  incentive
               compensation.

          (b)  Not applicable.

          (c)  As shown in the  table  below,  Farmer  Mac  repurchased  191,810
               shares  of its  Class C  Non-Voting  Common  Stock  during  third
               quarter 2005 at an average price of $24.56 per share.  All of the
               repurchased shares were purchased in open market transactions and
               were retired to become  authorized but unissued shares  available
               for future issuance.
