</TABLE>


            (d)  Reclassifications

     Certain  reclassifications of prior period information were made to conform
to the current period presentation.

          (e)  New Accounting Standards

     As amended, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting
for Derivative  Instruments and Hedging Activities ("SFAS 133") became effective
as of January 1, 2001.  SFAS 133 requires  financial  derivatives to be measured
and recorded at fair value.  Pursuant to generally accepted accounting practices
prior to the  January  1,  2001  effective  date of SFAS 133,  derivatives  were
previously  accounted  for as  off-balance  sheet  items  and  disclosed  in the
consolidated financial statement footnotes.

     The cumulative effect of this change in accounting principles recognized on
January  1, 2001 was a  reduction  to net  income  of  $726,000  and a  negative
adjustment to other  comprehensive  income within  stockholders'  equity of $8.6
million.  As part of the  implementation  of SFAS 133,  Farmer Mac  reclassified
certain investment  securities  classified as held to maturity and available for
sale as trading securities.  The Corporation expects that SFAS 133 will increase
volatility in earnings and accumulated other comprehensive income.

     In  September  2000,  the  Financial   Accounting  Standards  Board  issued
Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 140,  Accounting for Transfers
and Servicing of Financial  Assets and  Extinguishments  of  Liabilities  ("SFAS
140").  SFAS 140 was applied as of April 1, 2001 as  required  by the  standard.
SFAS 140 does not materially affect the  Corporation's  results of operations or
financial  position,  but does result in the  Corporation  classifying  as loans
certain AMBS that previously would have been classified as Farmer Mac guaranteed
securities.

            (f)   Financial Derivatives

     Farmer Mac enters  into  derivative  instruments  as an  end-user,  not for
speculative purposes. Farmer Mac enters into interest-rate contracts,  including
interest-rate swaps and caps, to adjust the characteristics of Farmer Mac's debt
to match more  closely the  characteristics  of the  Corporation's  assets or to
provide better returns on its  investments.  Farmer Mac enters into forward sale
contracts of GSE debt and  mortgage-backed  securities  and U.S.  Treasury based
futures  contracts  to  manage  interest-rate  risk  exposure  related  to  loan
purchases and anticipated debt issuances.

     Interest-rate  swaps used to hedge corporate debt investments,  and forward
sale  contracts  used to hedge Farmer Mac's loan  portfolio,  are classified and
accounted  for as fair  value  hedges.  Interest-rate  swaps  and  forward  sale
contracts used to hedge  anticipated debt issuances are classified and accounted
for as cash flow  hedges.  Other  financial  derivatives,  such as  futures  and
interest-rate  caps, are not assigned an accounting  hedge  designation.  Farmer
Mac's  financial  derivatives  are carried at their fair values.  For fair value
hedges,  the  changes  in the fair  values of the  derivatives,  along  with the
changes in fair values of the hedged items,  are recorded in earnings.  For cash
flow hedges,  the changes in the fair values of the  derivatives are recorded in
other  comprehensive  income  and  any  hedge  ineffectiveness  is  recorded  in
earnings.   For  derivative   instruments  not  assigned  an  accounting   hedge
designation,  the changes in fair value are recorded in earnings.  Net after-tax
charges  against  earnings  under SFAS 133 during  second  quarter  2001 totaled
$102,000, and net after-tax increases to other comprehensive income totaled $3.3
million.  Farmer Mac estimates  that $0.9 million of the total amount  currently
reported in accumulated  other  comprehensive  income will be reclassified  into
earnings  within  the  next  twelve  months.  Substantially  all of this  amount
represents  the  estimated  present  value  of  the  net  interest  payments  on
interest-rate  swap  contracts,  using  fair  values  as of June 30,  2001,  and
assuming no change in interest rates.  Those  interest-rate  swap contracts were
entered  into to  derive a lower  effective  fixed  rate cost of  borrowing  for
periods  of up to 15 years  than  would  otherwise  have been  available  to the
Corporation in the conventional debt market. For the period ended June 30, 2001,
the  ineffectiveness  of designated  hedges recognized as part of net income was
immaterial.

Note 2.  Off-Balance Sheet Guaranteed Securities

     For  information  regarding the  off-balance  sheet risks  associated  with
Farmer Mac's  guarantees of AMBS, see  "Management's  Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Management - Credit Risk."


Note 3.  Comprehensive Income

     Comprehensive  income  (loss) is comprised of net income plus other changes
in  stockholders'  equity not resulting from  investments by or distributions to
stockholders. The following table sets forth comprehensive income (loss) for the
three and six months  ended June 30, 2001 and 2000.  The  changes in  unrealized
gains on  securities  available-for-sale  are net of the  related  deferred  tax
benefit (expense) of $7.8 million and $12.4 million for the three and six months
ended June 30, 2001, respectively, and ($1.4 million) and $253,000 for the three
and six months ended June 30, 2000,  respectively.  The change in the fair value
of financial  derivatives  classified  as cash flow hedges for the three and six
months ended June 30, 2001 is net of the related deferred tax benefit  (expense)
of ($1.8 million) and $155,000, respectively.

Item 2. Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
        of Operations

Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

     Certain statements made in this Form 10-Q are "forward-looking  statements"
within the meaning of the Private Securities  Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that
reflect  management's  current  expectations  for Farmer Mac's future  financial
results,   business   prospects  and  business   developments.   Forward-looking
statements  include,  without  limitation,   any  statement  that  may  predict,
forecast,  indicate or imply future results,  performance or  achievements,  and
typically are accompanied by, and identified with, such terms as  "anticipates,"
"believes,"  "estimates,"  "expects,"  "intends,"  "plans," "should" and similar
expressions.   The  following  management's  discussion  and  analysis  includes
forward-looking  statements  addressing  Farmer Mac's prospects for earnings and
growth in loan  purchase,  guarantee and  securitization  volume;  trends in net
interest  income,  delinquencies  and provision  for losses;  changes in capital
position;  and other business and financial matters.  Management's  expectations
for  Farmer  Mac's  future  necessarily  involve  a number  of  assumptions  and
estimates and the  evaluation  of risks and  uncertainties.  Various  factors or
events could cause Farmer Mac's  actual  results to differ  materially  from the
expectations  as  expressed  or  implied  by  the  forward-looking   statements,
including:  uncertainties regarding the rate and direction of development of the
secondary  market  for  agricultural  mortgage  loans;  substantial  changes  in
interest rates, the agricultural  economy  (including  agricultural land values,
commodity  prices,  export  demand for U.S.  agricultural  products  and federal
assistance to farmers) or the general economy;  uncertainties as to the intended
operation of the new risk-based capital standard  promulgated by the Farm Credit
Administration, which Farmer Mac is required to comply with by May 23, 2002; the
implementation of additional statutory or regulatory  restrictions applicable to
Farmer Mac or  restrictions  on Farmer Mac's  investment  authority;  protracted
adverse weather,  market or other  conditions  affecting  particular  geographic
regions or particular commodities related to agricultural mortgage loans backing
Farmer Mac  guaranteed  securities;  legislative or regulatory  developments  or
interpretations  of Farmer Mac's statutory  charter that could adversely  affect
Farmer Mac or the ability of certain  lenders to  participate in its programs or
the  terms  of any such  participation;  the  availability  of debt  funding  in
sufficient  quantities and at favorable rates to support continued  growth;  the
rate  of  growth  in  agricultural  mortgage  indebtedness;   the  size  of  the
agricultural mortgage market;  borrower preferences for fixed-rate  agricultural
mortgage indebtedness;  the willingness of lenders to sell agricultural mortgage
loans into the Farmer Mac  secondary  market;  the  willingness  of investors to
invest  in   agricultural   mortgage-backed   securities;   competition  in  the
origination  or  purchase  of  agricultural  mortgage  loans  and  the  sale  of
agricultural  mortgage-backed  and debt  securities;  or changes in Farmer Mac's
status as a government-sponsored enterprise.

     The foregoing factors are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report may
include additional factors that could adversely affect Farmer Mac's business and
its financial  performance.  Furthermore,  new risk factors  emerge from time to
time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor
assess the  effects of such  factors on Farmer  Mac's  business or the extent to
which any factor, or combination of factors,  may cause actual results to differ
materially  from the  expectations  expressed or implied by the  forward-looking
statements.  Given these  potential risks and  uncertainties,  no undue reliance
should be placed on any  forward-looking  statements  expressed  in this report.
Furthermore, Farmer Mac undertakes no obligation to release publicly the results
of revisions to any  forward-looking  statements that may be made to reflect any
future events or circumstances.

Results of Operations

     Operating  Results.  SFAS 133  requires  the  change in the fair  values of
certain financial derivatives to be reflected in the Corporation's net income or
other  comprehensive  income.  Management  believes  that  reporting  results by
reference to operating income and operating  revenues,  excluding the cumulative
effect of the  change in  accounting  principles  recognized  on January 1, 2001
under SFAS 133 and its ongoing  effects during the reporting  periods,  provides
meaningful  operating  measures  of Farmer  Mac's  financial  performance.  Such
information is presented to supplement,  not replace, net income, revenues, cash
from  operations,  or any other  operating  or  liquidity  performance  measures
prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles.

     Overview.  Net income for second quarter 2001, including the cumulative and
ongoing  effects of SFAS 133 during the  quarter,  was $3.7 million or $0.32 per
share.  Net income for second  quarter 2000 was $2.5 million or $0.22 per share.
This represents a 45 percent increase in net income per share.  Operating income
for second quarter 2001 did not differ materially from net income.

     Farmer Mac's revenue growth  continued in second  quarter 2001,  reflecting
the  effects of  outstanding  guarantee  volume as of June 30,  2001 that was 50
percent  higher than at the close of the second  quarter  2000 and net  interest
income earned on a higher average balance of outstanding interest-earning assets
that was 51 percent  higher than during the second  quarter 2000.  During second
quarter 2001,  Farmer Mac (1) purchased $57.0 million of guaranteed  portions of
loans guaranteed by the United States  Department of Agriculture  ("USDA"),  (2)
purchased  $85.4  million of Farmer Mac I loans and (3) added $499.5  million in
long-term standby purchase commitments.

     Guarantee  volume growth was achieved  during  second  quarter 2001 despite
continued  unfavorable  economic  conditions in the  agricultural  sector.  Weak
market opportunities for agricultural commodities and products and low commodity
prices have persisted  throughout 2000 and into 2001. Total direct  governmental
payments to the  agricultural  sector for 2000, as estimated by the USDA, were a
record  $22.9 billion,  resulting  in net cash farm  income  levels  during 2000
significantly above the decade (1991-2000)  average.  The federal income support
is not allocated equally to producers of all agricultural commodities,  however,
and farmers and ranchers  producing  agricultural  commodities that receive such
support  should  demonstrate  greater  liquidity  than those who do not  receive
payments. USDA currently forecasts net cash farm income for 2001 to be above the
decade  average,   based  in  part  on  legislation  to  provide  an  additional
$5.5 billion  of  federal  support to the  agricultural  sector in 2001 that the
President  signed  into law on August  13,  2001.  Farmer Mac  responded  to the
continued   unfavorable  economic  conditions  in  the  agricultural  sector  by
re-emphasizing  to  agricultural  lenders  their  ability  to use  Farmer  Mac's
programs to reduce their  concentrated  exposures to agricultural  credit risks.
Although  Farmer Mac believes  that the increased  interest in portfolio  sales,
swaps and long-term standby  commitments  during the second quarter of 2001 is a
good  indication  that the  Corporation  has  positioned  itself  for growth and
anticipates  additional portfolio transactions during the remainder of 2001, the
total volume of those transactions is uncertain at this time.

     During second quarter 2001,  Farmer Mac, at the request of the  Agriculture
Committees in both the Senate and House of Representatives,  presented testimony
in connection with Congress'  consideration of the  reauthorization  of the farm
bill. In that testimony, the Corporation suggested that Congress consider adding
the authority to establish a secondary market for rural development loans to the
Corporation's  authorities.  Since that  testimony was  presented,  Farmer Mac's
management  has had  discussions  with  Committee  staff  and  others  who  have
expressed interest in Farmer Mac's suggestion, with a goal of developing a rural
development secondary market proposal to submit to Congress. At this time, there
can be no assurance  that such a proposal  will be developed  or, if  developed,
enacted into law. If such a proposal  were enacted into law, no assurance  could
be given that  sufficient  volume or income  could be  generated  to  materially
affect Farmer Mac's profitability.

     Set forth below is a more  detailed  discussion  of Farmer Mac's results of
operations.

     Net  Interest  Income.  Net  interest  income was $6.4  million  for second
quarter 2001 and $11.9 million  year-to-date,  compared to $4.2 million and $8.9
million for the same periods in 2000.  The  increase in net interest  income was
primarily  attributable to increases in the balance of program assets, driven by
Farmer Mac's retention of its guaranteed agricultural mortgage-backed securities
("AMBS").  The  following  table  provides  information  regarding  the  average
balances  and rates of  interest-earning  assets and  funding for the six months
ended June 30, 2001 and 2000.

     Other Income.  Other income, which is comprised of guarantee fee income and
miscellaneous  income,  totaled  $3.8  million for second  quarter 2001 and $7.4
million  for  year-to-date  2001,  compared to $2.7  million  and $5.5  million,
respectively,  in 2000.  Guarantee  fee income,  the largest  component of other
income,  was $3.7 million for second quarter 2001,  compared to $2.8 million for
second quarter 2000. The relative  increase in guarantee fee income  reflects an
increase in the average balance of outstanding guarantees.  Miscellaneous income
was $116,000 for second  quarter 2001,  compared to a loss of $10,000 for second
quarter 2000.

     Expenses.  During second  quarter  2001,  operating  expenses  totaled $2.8
million, compared to $2.1 million for second quarter 2000. Operating expenses as
a  percentage  of operating  revenues  for second  quarter 2001 and 2000 were 28
percent and 30 percent, respectively.

     Farmer Mac's  provision for principal and interest  losses was $1.4 million
for second quarter 2001 and $2.8 million for year-to-date 2001, compared to $1.1
million and $2.4  million  for the same  periods in 2000.  As of June 30,  2001,
Farmer  Mac's  reserve for losses  totaled  $13.2  million,  or 0.43  percent of
outstanding  post-1996 Act loans,  compared to $9.0 million, or 0.46 percent, as
of June 30, 2000.

     The provision for income taxes totaled $2.1 million for second quarter 2001
and $3.7  million for  year-to-date  2001,  compared to $1.4  million for second
quarter 2000 and $2.7 million for year-to date 2000.  Farmer Mac's effective tax
rate for the six months ended June 30, 2001 was approximately 35.5 percent.

          See "Overview"  above for a discussion  regarding  loans purchased and
     guaranteed by Farmer Mac.

     Indicators of future  purchase and  guarantee  volume  include  outstanding
commitments  to  purchase  loans and the total  balance of loans  submitted  for
approval or approved but not yet purchased.  Many purchase  commitments  entered
into by Farmer Mac are mandatory  delivery  commitments.  If a seller  obtains a
mandatory  commitment and is unable to deliver the loans as required thereunder,
Farmer Mac  requires  the  seller to pay a fee to  modify,  extend or cancel the
commitment.  As of  June  30,  2001,  outstanding  commitments  to  purchase  or
guarantee Farmer Mac I loans totaled $15.9 million,  compared to $8.6 million as
of June 30, 2000. Of the total Farmer Mac I commitments  outstanding  as of June
30, 2001 and 2000, $10.0 million and $3.8 million, respectively,  were mandatory
commitments.  In accordance with SFAS 133, as of June 30, 2001, the Farmer Mac I
mandatory  commitments and the outstanding  Farmer Mac II mandatory  commitments
for $3.6  million are recorded as part of  financial  derivatives  at their fair
market  values of  $186,000  and  $68,000,  respectively.  Loans  submitted  for
approval or approved but not yet committed to purchase totaled $160.0 million as
of June 30, 2001,  compared to $117.3  million as of June 30,  2000.  Not all of
these loans are purchased, as some are denied for credit reasons or withdrawn by
the seller.

     While significant progress has been made in developing the secondary market
for  agricultural  mortgages,  Farmer Mac  continues to face the  challenges  of
establishing  a market  where  none  previously  existed.  Use of  Farmer  Mac's
programs is increasing among lenders,  reflecting the competitive  rates,  terms
and products  offered and the  advantages  Farmer Mac's  programs  provide.  For
Farmer Mac to maximize its business  development and profitability over the long
term,  the use of Farmer Mac's  programs and products by  agricultural  mortgage
lenders, whether traditional or non-traditional, must continue to expand.

Balance Sheet Review

     During the first half of 2001,  total assets  increased  by $48.2  million,
primarily due to an increase in  on-balance  sheet  program  assets  (Farmer Mac
guaranteed securities and loans). For further information regarding both on- and
off-balance sheet guaranteed securities,  see "Supplemental  Information" below.
Total liabilities  increased by $70.2 million from December 31, 2000 to June 30,
2001 primarily due to an increase in notes payable.

     Farmer Mac's  statutory core capital  totaled $110.6 million as of June 30,
2001,  compared with $101.2 million as of December 31, 2000 and $95.5 million as
of June 30, 2000. The core capital  balance as of June 30, 2001 exceeded  Farmer
Mac's statutory minimum capital requirement by approximately $7.7 million.

     On April 12, 2001, the Farm Credit Administration  ("FCA") issued its final
risk-based capital regulation for Farmer Mac. The regulation became effective on
May 23,  2001,  and Farmer Mac will be required to meet the  risk-based  capital
standard by May 23, 2002.  As noted in our June 12, 2000  comment  letter to the
FCA on the proposed  regulation,  Farmer Mac believes  that certain  significant
aspects of the risk-based  capital regulation do not comply with the authorizing
statute. The economic model incorporated in the regulation is extremely complex,
and we are still analyzing its potential effects.  Farmer Mac has requested that
FCA assist us in understanding the operation of the regulation and the model. If
unchanged, the regulation--particularly those provisions that suggest to us that
the FCA went outside the authorizing  statute--could  lead to an increase in the
capital  requirement  for certain  newly  guaranteed  off-balance  sheet program
assets and so alter Farmer Mac's  strategic  plan for future  growth.  While the
Corporation is at this time uncertain whether the regulation,  as issued,  would
alter that  strategic  plan, we expect that any issues raised by the  regulation
will be resolved in accordance with the authorizing statute before Farmer Mac is
required to meet the risk-based capital standard.

     Average return on equity, excluding the effects of SFAS 115, Accounting for
Certain  Investments  in Debt and  Equity  Securities,  and SFAS  133,  was 13.8
percent for second  quarter  2001,  compared to 10.6 percent for second  quarter
2000 and 12.3 percent for first quarter 2001.

Risk Management

     Interest-Rate Risk. Farmer Mac's asset and liability  management  objective
is to limit the effects of changes in interest  rates on its equity and earnings
to  within  acceptable  risk  tolerance  levels.  In doing so,  Farmer  Mac uses
callable debt and  derivative  financial  instruments,  including  interest-rate
swaps and caps (collectively "interest-rate contracts"),  forward sale contracts
involving  GSE  debt  and  mortgage-backed   securities  and  futures  contracts
involving U.S. Treasury securities.  Farmer Mac uses interest-rate  contracts to
alter the interest-rate  characteristics of specific  investments or debt, which
enable  Farmer  Mac  better to match the  interest-rate  characteristics  of its
investments  and debt.  As of June 30, 2001 and December 31, 2000,  the notional
amount of  interest-rate  contracts  totaled  $1.06  billion and $1.11  billion,
respectively.  Farmer Mac uses forward sales and futures contracts to reduce its
interest-rate  risk exposure to loans committed or purchased and not yet sold or
funded as retained  investments.  As of June 30, 2001,  the  notional  amount of
outstanding forward sale and futures contracts totaled $143.2 million,  compared
to $8.6 million as of December 31, 2000.

     One method Farmer Mac uses to monitor its exposure to interest-rate risk is
to measure the  sensitivity  of its market value of equity (MVE) to an immediate
and permanent  parallel shift of the U.S.  Treasury  yield curve.  The following
schedule  summarizes the results of Farmer Mac's MVE sensitivity  analysis as of
June 30, 2001 and December 31, 2000.

</TABLE>



     Farmer Mac assumes 100 percent of the credit risk on  post-1996  Act Farmer
Mac I loans;  pre-1996  Act Farmer Mac I loans are  supported  by  mandatory  10
percent first loss subordinated interests that mitigate credit exposure;  Farmer
Mac II loans are guaranteed by the USDA. Farmer Mac believes it has little or no
credit risk  exposure to  pre-1996  Act Farmer Mac I loans  because of the first
loss subordinated interests related to pools of those loans, or to Farmer Mac II
loans because of the USDA guarantee.

     As of June 30, 2001,  post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I loans that were 90 days or
more past due, in foreclosure or in bankruptcy  represented  1.72 percent of the
outstanding  principal balance of all post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I loans, compared
to 1.25  percent  as of June 30,  2000 and 2.62  percent  as of March 31,  2001.
Farmer Mac  anticipates  fluctuations  in the  delinquency  rate from quarter to
quarter,  with higher levels likely as of March 31 and September 30 of each year
due to the  semiannual  payment  characteristics  of most Farmer Mac loans.  The
year-over-year  increase is reflective of liquidity  issues in the  agricultural
sector in general and declines in real estate values related to commodities that
do not directly  benefit from direct  governmental  payments to the agricultural
sector.

     Total direct governmental  payments to the agricultural sector for 2000, as
estimated by the USDA, were a record  $22.9 billion,  resulting in net cash farm
income levels during 2000 significantly  above the decade  (1991-2000)  average.
The  federal  income  support  is not  allocated  equally  to  producers  of all
agricultural   commodities,   however,   and  farmers  and  ranchers   producing
agricultural  commodities that receive significant federal income support should
demonstrate  greater  liquidity  than those who do not  receive  payments.  USDA
currently  forecasts  net cash  farm  income  for 2001 to be  above  the  decade
average,  based  in part on the  August  13,  2001  enactment  of an  additional
$5.5 billion of federal support for the agricultural sector in 2001.

     Although losses are expected to be incurred on the post-1996 Act Farmer Mac
I loans,  Farmer Mac believes  that those losses are  adequately  covered by the
reserve for losses,  based on the value of the collateral  supporting the loans.
Farmer  Mac  believes  that its  guaranteed  portfolio  consists  of loans  with
loan-to-value ratios that adequately protect against losses at liquidation, with
the  exception  of  certain  loans  that  are  secured  in  whole  or in part by
depreciable  assets  or by real  estate  planted  with  commodities  that do not
directly benefit from direct governmental  payments to the agricultural  sector.
Those instances may result in Farmer Mac incurring losses upon loan liquidation,
such as the $600,000 in losses  recognized  on  delinquent  loans during  second
quarter 2001. The following table summarizes the post-1996 Act  delinquencies by
original loan-to-value ratio (calculated by dividing the original loan principal
balance by the original appraised value):
