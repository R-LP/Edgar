Item 1. Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

     The following interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
of  the  Federal   Agricultural   Mortgage  Corporation  ("Farmer  Mac"  or  the
"Corporation")  have been prepared  pursuant to the rules and regulations of the
Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (the  "SEC").   These  interim  unaudited
condensed  consolidated  financial  statements  reflect all normal and recurring
adjustments that are, in the opinion of management,  necessary to present a fair
statement of the  financial  condition  and the results of  operations  and cash
flows of Farmer Mac for the interim periods presented.  Certain  information and
footnote  disclosures   normally  included  in  annual  consolidated   financial
statements  have been  condensed  or  omitted  as  permitted  by such  rules and
regulations.  Management  believes that the  disclosures are adequate to present
fairly the condensed  consolidated  financial position,  condensed  consolidated
results of operations and condensed  consolidated cash flows as of the dates and
for the  periods  presented.  These  interim  unaudited  condensed  consolidated
financial  statements  should  be read in  conjunction  with  the  audited  2004
consolidated  financial  statements of Farmer Mac included in the  Corporation's
Annual  Report on Form 10-K for the year ended  December 31,  2004.  Results for

Note 1.  Accounting Policies

(a)   Cash and Cash Equivalents

     Farmer Mac considers  highly liquid  investment  securities  with remaining
maturities  of  three  months  or  less  at the  time  of  purchase  to be  cash
equivalents. Changes in the balance of cash and cash equivalents are reported in
the condensed  consolidated  statements of cash flows.  The following table sets
forth information  regarding certain cash and non-cash  transactions for the six
months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004.

     (b) Allowance for Losses

     As of June 30, 2005,  Farmer Mac  maintained a $16.1 million  allowance and
contingent  obligation  for probable  losses  ("allowance  for losses") to cover
estimated  probable losses on loans held for investment,  real estate owned, and
loans underlying  long-term standby purchase  commitments  ("LTSPCs") and Farmer
Mac I Guaranteed  Securities  issued after the Farm Credit  System Reform Act of
1996 (the "1996 Act") in  accordance  with  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting
Standards  No. 5,  Accounting  for  Contingencies  ("SFAS 5") and  Statement  of
Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 114, Accounting by Creditors for Impairment
of a Loan,  as  amended  ("SFAS  114").  The  methodology  for  determining  the
allowance  for  losses  is the same for  loans  held for  investment  and  loans
underlying  post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities and LTSPCs because
Farmer Mac believes the ultimate credit risk is  substantially  the same,  i.e.,
the underlying agricultural mortgage loans all meet the same credit underwriting
and appraisal standards.

     The allowance for losses is increased through periodic  provisions for loan
losses that are charged  against net interest  income and  provisions for losses
that are charged to operating  expense and is reduced by charge-offs  for actual
losses, net of recoveries. Negative provisions for loan losses or provisions for
losses are recorded in the event that the estimate of probable  losses as of the
end of a period is lower than the estimate at the beginning of the period.

     The table below  summarizes  the  components of Farmer Mac's  allowance for
losses as of June 30, 2005 and December 31, 2004.

Guaranteed Securities issued prior to the 1996 Act are supported by unguaranteed
first loss  subordinated  interests,  which are expected to exceed the estimated
credit losses on those loans. The guaranteed portions collateralizing Farmer Mac
II Guaranteed  Securities  are  guaranteed  by the United  States  Department of
Agriculture  ("USDA").  Each USDA guarantee is an obligation  backed by the full
faith and credit of the United States.  To date,  Farmer Mac has  experienced no
credit  losses on any pre-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities or on any
Farmer Mac II Guaranteed Securities and does not expect to incur any such losses
in the future.

     The  following  table  summarizes  the changes in the  components of Farmer
Mac's  allowance for losses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2005 and
2004:

     As of June 30,  2005,  Farmer Mac  analyzed  its $90.9  million of impaired
assets for collateral shortfalls against updated appraised values, other updated
collateral  valuations  or  discounted  values.  Of the $90.9  million of assets
analyzed, $84.4 million were adequately collateralized.  For the $6.5 million of
assets that were not adequately collateralized, individual collateral shortfalls
totaled $0.8 million.  Accordingly,  Farmer Mac recorded specific  allowances of
$0.8 million for those  under-collateralized  assets as of June 30, 2005.  As of
June   30,   2005,   after   the   allocation   of   specific    allowances   to
under-collateralized  loans,  Farmer Mac had additional  non-specific or general
allowances of $15.3  million,  bringing the total  allowance for losses to $16.1
million.

     The balance of impaired  assets,  both on- and off-balance  sheet,  and the
related allowance specifically allocated to those impaired assets as of June 30,
2005 and December 31, 2004 are summarized in the following table:

     (c) Financial Derivatives

     Farmer Mac enters into  financial  derivative  transactions  principally to
protect against risk from the effects of market price or interest rate movements
on the value of certain assets and future cash flows or debt  issuance,  not for
trading or  speculative  purposes.  Farmer Mac enters  into  interest  rate swap
contracts  principally to adjust the  characteristics  of its short-term debt to
match more closely the cash flow and duration characteristics of its longer-term
mortgage  and  other  assets,  and also to  adjust  the  characteristics  of its
long-term debt to match more closely the cash flow and duration  characteristics
of  its  short-term   assets,   thereby  reducing   interest  rate  risk.  These
transactions  also may provide an overall lower effective cost of borrowing than
would otherwise be available in the conventional debt market.

     All financial  derivatives  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value
as  a  freestanding  asset  or  liability.   Financial  derivatives  in  hedging
relationships  that mitigate exposure to changes in the fair value of assets are
considered  fair value hedges.  Financial  derivatives in hedging  relationships
that mitigate the exposure to the  variability in expected  future cash flows or
other  forecasted  transactions  are  considered  cash  flow  hedges.  Financial
derivatives  that do not satisfy the hedging  criteria of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative  Instruments and Hedging
Activities, as amended ("SFAS 133") are not accounted for as hedges, and changes
in the fair  values of those  financial  derivatives  are  reported  as gains or
losses on financial derivatives and trading assets in the condensed consolidated
statements of operations.

     The  following  table  summarizes   information  related  to  Farmer  Mac's
financial derivatives as of June 30, 2005 and December 31, 2004:

     As of June 30,  2005,  Farmer Mac had  approximately  $32.0  million of net
after-tax  unrealized  losses on cash flow hedges included in accumulated  other
comprehensive income/(loss). These amounts will be reclassified into earnings in
the same  period or  periods  during  which the hedged  forecasted  transactions
(either  the payment of interest  or the  issuance  of  discount  notes)  affect
earnings  or  immediately  when it becomes  probable  that the  original  hedged
forecasted  transaction  will not occur  within  two  months  of the  originally
specified  date.  Over the next twelve  months,  Farmer Mac estimates  that $5.9
million of the amount  currently  reported in  accumulated  other  comprehensive
income/(loss) will be reclassified into earnings. For the quarter ended June 30,
2005,  any  ineffectiveness  related  to  Farmer  Mac's  designated  hedges  was
insignificant.

     (d) Earnings Per Common Share

     Basic earnings per common share are based on the weighted-average number of
common shares  outstanding.  Diluted  earnings per common share are based on the
weighted-average  number of common  shares  outstanding  adjusted to include all
potentially  dilutive common stock options.  The following  schedule  reconciles
basic and diluted earnings per common share ("EPS") for the three and six months
ended June 30, 2005 and 2004:

     During second quarter 2005,  Farmer Mac  repurchased  272,988 shares of its
Class C Non-Voting Common Stock at an average price of $18.36 per share pursuant
to the  Corporation's  previously  announced  stock  repurchase  program.  These
repurchases  reduced the  Corporation's  capital by approximately  $5.0 million.
During the six months ended June 30, 2005, Farmer Mac repurchased 564,442 shares
of its Class C Non-Voting  Common Stock at an average price of $19.38 leading to
a reduction in capital of approximately $11.0 million.

     (e) Stock-Based Compensation

     Farmer Mac accounts for its stock-based  employee  compensation plans using
the intrinsic value method of accounting for employee stock options  pursuant to
Accounting  Principles  Board  Opinion No. 25,  Accounting  for Stock  Issued to
Employees  ("APB  25"),  and  has  adopted  the  disclosure-only  provisions  of
Statement of Financial  Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation,  as amended ("SFAS 123"). Accordingly, no compensation expense was
recognized  in second  quarter 2005 or second  quarter  2004 for employee  stock
option plans.  Had Farmer Mac elected to use the fair value method of accounting
for employee  stock options,  net income  available to common  stockholders  and
earnings  per share for the three and six months  ended  June 30,  2005 and 2004
would have been  reduced to the pro forma  amounts  indicated  in the  following

     (f) Reclassifications

     Certain  reclassifications of prior period information were made to conform
to the current period presentation.

     (g) New Accounting Standards

     In March 2004, the Emerging  Issues Task Force ("EITF")  amended EITF 03-1,
The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary  Impairment, to introduce a three-step model
to: (1) determine  whether an investment is impaired;  (2) evaluate  whether the
impairment  is  other-than-temporary;  and (3) account for  other-than-temporary
impairments. In part, this amendment requires companies to apply qualitative and
quantitative  measures  to  determine  whether a decline  in the fair value of a
security is  other-than-temporary.  The guidance in EITF 03-1 is  effective  for
reporting  periods  beginning after June 15, 2004, with the exception of certain
sections,  which have been deferred.  Farmer Mac is evaluating the impact of the
amendment and will adopt it when it is effective in full. In the interim, Farmer
Mac continues to apply earlier authoritative accounting guidance, primarily SFAS
115 and EITF 99-20,  Recognition of Interest  Income and Impairment on Purchased
and Retained  Beneficial  Interests in  Securitized  Financial  Assets,  for the
measurement and recognition of  other-than-temporary  impairment of its debt and
equity securities.

     In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
No. 123 (revised 2004),  Share-Based  Payment ("SFAS 123(R)").  SFAS 123(R) is a
revision  of SFAS  123 and  supersedes  APB 25 and  its  related  implementation
guidance.  SFAS 123(R)  requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee
services  received in exchange for an award of equity  instruments  based on the
grant-date fair value of the award. That cost will be recognized over the period
during  which an employee is  required  to provide  service in exchange  for the
award.  The  grant-date  fair  value  of  employee  share  options  and  similar
instruments  will be  estimated  using  option-pricing  models  adjusted for the
unique  characteristics  of  those  instruments.   SFAS  123(R)  eliminates  the
alternative  to use APB 25's  intrinsic  value  method  of  accounting  that was
provided in SFAS 123 as originally issued. Currently, as discussed in Note 1(e),
Farmer Mac accounts for its stock-based  employee  compensation  plans using the
intrinsic value method of accounting for employee stock options  pursuant to APB
25 and has adopted the  disclosure-only  provisions of SFAS 123. The guidance in
SFAS 123(R) is  effective  for  reporting  periods  beginning  no later than the
beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005.  Farmer Mac is
evaluating the impact of SFAS 123(R) and will adopt it when effective.

    Effect on fair value of a 20% adverse change     $ (34,879)
</TABLE>

     These sensitivities are hypothetical.  As the figures indicate,  changes in
fair value based on 10 percent or 20 percent variations in assumptions generally
cannot be extrapolated  because the relationship of the change in assumptions to
the change in fair value may not be linear.  Also, in this table the effect of a
variation in a particular  assumption on the fair value of the retained interest
is calculated  without changing any other  assumption.  In fact,  changes in one
factor  may  result in changes in  another  (for  example,  increases  in market
interest  rates  may  result  in lower  prepayments),  which  might  amplify  or
counteract the sensitivities.

Note 3.  Off-Balance Sheet Guarantees and Long-Term Standby Purchase Commitments

Overview

     Farmer Mac offers  approved  agricultural  and rural  residential  mortgage
lenders two  off-balance  sheet  alternatives  to increase  their  liquidity  or
lending  capacity  while  retaining the cash flow  benefits of their loans:  (1)
Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities,  which are available through either the Farmer
Mac I program or the Farmer Mac II program,  and (2) LTSPCs, which are available
only  through  the Farmer Mac I program.  Both of these  alternatives  result in
off-balance sheet transactions for Farmer Mac.


Off-Balance Sheet Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities

     Periodically Farmer Mac transfers  agricultural  mortgage loans into trusts
that are used as vehicles for the  securitization of the transferred  assets and
the beneficial  interests in the trusts are sold to third party  investors.  The
table  below  summarizes  certain  cash  flows  received  from and paid to these
trusts.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and  Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
        of Operations

     Please read the following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition  and Results of  Operations  in  conjunction  with:  (1) the unaudited
condensed  consolidated  financial  statements and the related notes that appear
elsewhere  in this report;  and (2) Farmer Mac's Annual  Report on Form 10-K for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004.

Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

     Certain  statements  made in this report are  "forward-looking  statements"
within  the  meaning of the  Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform Act of 1995
pertaining  to  management's  current  expectations  as to Farmer  Mac's  future
financial results, business prospects and business developments. Forward-looking
statements  include,  without  limitation,   any  statement  that  may  predict,
forecast,  indicate or imply future results,  performance or  achievements,  and
typically are accompanied by, and identified with, such terms as  "anticipates,"
"believes,"  "expects,"  "intends," "should" and similar phrases.  The following
management's  discussion  and  analysis  includes   forward-looking   statements
addressing Farmer Mac's:
     o    prospects for earnings;
     o    prospects for growth in loan purchase,  guarantee,  securitization and
          LTSPC volume;
     o    trends in net interest income;
     o    trends in provisions for losses;
     o    trends in expenses;
     o    changes in capital position; and
     o    other business and financial matters.

     Management's  expectations  for Farmer Mac's future  necessarily  involve a
number  of   assumptions   and  estimates  and  the   evaluation  of  risks  and
uncertainties. Various factors could cause Farmer Mac's actual results or events
to differ  materially  from the  expectations  as  expressed  or  implied by the
forward-looking statements, including uncertainties regarding:
     o    the rate and  direction of  development  of the  secondary  market for
          agricultural mortgage loans;
     o    the possible  establishment  of  additional  statutory  or  regulatory
          restrictions or constraints on Farmer Mac that could hamper its growth
          or diminish its profitability;
     o    increases  in general  and  administrative  expenses  attributable  to
          growth of the business and the regulatory  environment,  including the
          hiring of additional personnel with expertise in key functional areas;
     o    legislative or regulatory  developments or  interpretations  of Farmer
          Mac's statutory  charter that could  adversely  affect Farmer Mac, the
          ability  of  Farmer  Mac to  offer  new  products  or the  ability  or
          motivation of certain  lenders to  participate  in its programs or the
          terms of any such  participation,  or increase the cost of  regulation
          and related corporate activities;
     o    possible  reaction  in  the  financial  markets  to  events  involving
          government sponsored enterprises ("GSEs") other than Farmer Mac;
     o    Farmer Mac's access to the debt markets at favorable rates and terms;
     o    the  possible  effect of the  risk-based  capital  requirement,  which
          could,  under  certain  circumstances,  be in excess of the  statutory
          minimum capital requirement;
     o    the rate of growth in agricultural mortgage indebtedness;
     o    lender  interest  in Farmer  Mac  credit  products  and the Farmer Mac
          secondary market;
     o    borrower    preferences   for   fixed-rate    agricultural    mortgage
          indebtedness;
     o    competitive  pressures in the purchase of agricultural  mortgage loans
          and the  sale of  agricultural  mortgage-backed  securities  and  debt
          securities;
     o    substantial  changes in  interest  rates,  agricultural  land  values,
          commodity prices,  export demand for U.S. agricultural  products,  the
          general economy and other factors that may affect  delinquency  levels
          and credit losses;
     o    protracted  adverse  weather,  market  or other  conditions  affecting
          particular geographic regions or particular  agricultural  commodities
          or products related to agricultural  mortgage loans backing Farmer Mac
          I Guaranteed Securities or under LTSPCs;
     o    the willingness of investors to invest in agricultural mortgage-backed
          securities; or
     o    the effects on the  agricultural  economy or the value of agricultural
          real estate of any changes in federal assistance for agriculture.

     The foregoing factors are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report may
include additional factors that could adversely affect Farmer Mac's business and
its financial  performance.  Furthermore,  new risk factors  emerge from time to
time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor
assess the  effects of such  factors on Farmer  Mac's  business or the extent to
which any factor, or combination of factors,  may cause actual results to differ
materially  from the  expectations  expressed or implied by the  forward-looking
statements.  In light of  these  potential  risks  and  uncertainties,  no undue
reliance should be placed on any  forward-looking  statements  expressed in this
report. Furthermore, Farmer Mac undertakes no obligation to release publicly the
results  of  revisions  to any  forward-looking  statements  that may be made to
reflect any future events or circumstances,  except as otherwise mandated by the
SEC.

Critical Accounting Policy and Estimates

     The critical  accounting  policy that is both important to the portrayal of
Farmer Mac's financial condition and results of operations and requires complex,
subjective  judgments is the accounting policy for the allowance for losses. For
a discussion of Farmer Mac's critical accounting policy, as well as Farmer Mac's
use of  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect the  amounts  reported  in the
condensed  consolidated  financial  statements and related notes for the periods
presented,  see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results  of  Operations--Critical   Accounting  Policy  and  Estimates"  in  the
Corporation's  Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended  December 31, 2004,
filed with the SEC on March 16, 2005.

Results of Operations

     Overview.  Net income  available to common  stockholders for second quarter
2005 was $8.2  million  or $0.72 per  diluted  common  share,  compared  to $2.0
million or $0.16 per diluted common share for second quarter 2004. This increase
was due  principally  to the  after-tax  effects  of the  $3.8  million  gain on
financial  derivatives  in second  quarter 2005  compared to losses on financial
derivatives of $6.2 million in second quarter 2004 and to the recovery of losses
during second quarter 2005 of $0.3 million  compared to provisions for losses of
$1.6  million  during  second  quarter  2004.  Net  income  available  to common
stockholders  for the six months ended June 30, 2005 was $13.1  million or $1.13
per diluted  common share,  compared to $9.8 million or $0.80 per diluted common
share for the same period in 2004.  This  increase  was due  principally  to the
after-tax effects of the $2.0 million gain on financial  derivatives for the six
months ended June 30, 2005, compared to losses on financial  derivatives of $2.9
million for the same period in 2004.

     As of June 30, 2005, Farmer Mac's 90-day delinquencies  (Farmer Mac I loans
purchased or placed under  Farmer Mac I  Guaranteed  Securities  or LTSPCs after
changes to Farmer Mac's statutory charter in 1996 that were 90 days or more past
due, in foreclosure, restructured after delinquency, or in bankruptcy, excluding
loans  performing  under either their  original  loan terms or a  court-approved
bankruptcy plan) were $36.8 million,  representing 0.85 percent of the principal
balance  of all loans  held and loans  underlying  post-1996  Act  Farmer  Mac I
Guaranteed  Securities  and LTSPCs,  up from $32.8 million (0.68  percent) as of
June 30, 2004.

     As part of Farmer Mac's continuing evaluation of the overall credit quality
of its portfolio, the strong U.S. agricultural economy, the recent upward trends
in  agricultural  land  values and the  reduction  in Farmer  Mac's  outstanding
guarantees and commitments,  Farmer Mac determined that the appropriate level of
allowance for losses as of June 30, 2005 was $16.1 million. This resulted in the
release of  approximately  $0.3 million from the  allowance for losses in second
quarter  2005.  As of June 30, 2005,  the allowance for losses was $16.1 million
and 37 basis points relative to the outstanding Farmer Mac I portfolio, compared
to $17.1  million and 37 basis points as of December 31, 2004 and $21.8  million
and 45 basis points as of June 30, 2004.

      During second quarter 2005, Farmer Mac:

     o    added $96.4 million of Farmer Mac I eligible loans under LTSPCs;
     o    purchased  $20.4  million  of newly  originated  Farmer Mac I eligible
          loans; and
     o    purchased  $45.1  million  of Farmer Mac II  eligible  USDA-guaranteed
          portions of loans.

As of June 30, 2005, Farmer Mac's  outstanding  program volume was $5.2 billion,
which represented approximately 10.9 percent of management's estimate of a $47.8
billion market of eligible  agricultural  mortgage  loans.  Farmer Mac's ongoing
guarantee and commitment fee income reflects the annuity-like  revenue stream of
that  aspect of the  Corporation's  business.  That fee  income is earned on the
cumulative outstanding principal balance of Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities and
loans underlying LTSPCs. Accordingly,  guarantee and commitment fees increase or
decrease through changes in periodic business volume in proportion to the change
in that  cumulative  outstanding  principal  balance,  not in  proportion to the
change in periodic volume.

     Set forth below is a more  detailed  discussion  of Farmer Mac's results of
operations.

     Net Interest Income. Net interest income,  which does not include guarantee
fees for loans purchased prior to April 1, 2001 (the effective date of Statement
of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  140,  Accounting  for  Transfers  and
Servicing of Financial Assets and  Extinguishments of Liabilities ("SFAS 140")),
was $8.1 million for second  quarter  2005 and $15.9  million for the six months
ended June 30, 2005,  compared to $7.8 million and $17.3 million,  respectively,
for the same periods in 2004. The net interest yield was 87 basis points for the
six months ended June 30,  2005,  compared to 87 basis points for the six months
ended  June  30,  2004.  The  effect  of  SFAS  140 was  the  classification  of
approximately $1.9 million (10 basis points) of guarantee fee income as interest
income for the six months  ended June 30,  2005,  compared  to $2.2  million (11
basis points) for the six months ended June 30, 2004.

     Farmer Mac  classifies  the net  interest  income and  expense  realized on
financial   derivatives   that  are  not  in  fair  value  or  cash  flow  hedge
relationships  as gains and losses on financial  derivatives and trading assets.
For the six months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004, this classification resulted in
the  decrease of the net interest  yield of 3 basis  points and 5 basis  points,
respectively.

     The net  interest  yields for the six months  ended June 30,  2005 and 2004
included  the benefits of yield  maintenance  payments of 17 basis points and 12
basis points,  respectively.  Yield maintenance  payments  represent the present
value of expected  future interest income streams and accelerate the recognition
of interest  income from the  related  loans.  Because the timing and amounts of
these payments vary greatly,  variations do not necessarily indicate positive or
negative trends to gauge future financial results. For the six months ended June
30, 2005 and 2004, the effects of yield  maintenance  payments on net income and
diluted earnings per share were $2.0 million or $0.17 per diluted share and $1.6
million or $0.13 per diluted share, respectively.

     The table below provides information regarding  interest-earning assets and
funding  for the six  months  ended  June 30,  2005 and  2004.  The  balance  of
non-accruing loans is included in the average balance of interest-earning  loans
presented, though no related income is included in the income figures presented.
Therefore, as the balance of non-accruing loans increases or decreases,  the net
interest yield will decrease or increase  accordingly.  Net interest  income and
the yield will also  fluctuate due to the  uncertainty of the timing and size of
yield maintenance payments.

     The low  average  rate  earned on cash and cash  equivalents  reflects  the
relatively  low level of  short-term  interest  rates in 2005 and  2004,  and an
increase in short-term  market rates during the first two quarters of 2005.  The
increase in the average rate for  investments  reflects the general  increase in
short-term  rates and the floating rate nature of most  investments  acquired or
reset during the first two quarters of 2005 and outstanding during the first two
quarters of 2005.  The higher  average  rate on loans and Farmer Mac  Guaranteed
Securities  during the first six months of 2005  reflects the increase in market
rates during the latter part of 2004 and first part of 2005,  which affected the
rates on loans acquired or reset during that period and  outstanding  during the
first six months of 2005.  The average  rates on Farmer Mac's notes  payable due
within one year are consistent with general trends in average  short-term  rates
during the periods  presented.  The average rate on notes  payable due after one
year reflects the retirement of older, higher rate debt, as well as the issuance
of new debt at lower  relative  rates  during the latter  half of 2004 and first
part of 2005 and the relative  stability of long-term interest rates during 2005
and 2004.

each  category,  information is provided on changes  attributable  to changes in
volume (change in volume  multiplied by old rate) and changes in rate (change in
rate  multiplied  by old  volume).  Combined  rate/volume  variances,  the third
element of the  calculation,  are allocated  based on their  relative  size. The
increases due to rate reflect the  short-term or  adjustable-rate  nature of the
assets or liabilities and the general increases in short term market rates.

     Guarantee and  Commitment  Fees.  Guarantee and  commitment  fees were $4.9
million for second  quarter  2005 and $9.8 million for the six months ended June
30, 2005, compared to $5.3 million and $10.5 million, respectively, for the same
periods in 2004. The effects of the adoption of SFAS 140 were  classification as
interest  income of guarantee  fees of $0.9 million for second  quarter 2005 and
$1.9 million for the six months  ended June 30,  2005,  compared to $1.1 million
and  $2.2  million,  respectively,  for  the  same  periods  in  2004,  although
management  considers the amounts to have been earned in  consideration  for the
assumption of credit risk.  That portion of the  difference or "spread"  between
the cost of Farmer Mac's debt  funding for loans and the yield on post-1996  Act
Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities held on its books compensates for credit and
interest  rate risk.  When a post-1996  Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Security is
sold to a third  party,  Farmer Mac  continues  to  receive  the  guarantee  fee
component  of that spread,  which  continues  to  compensate  Farmer Mac for its
assumption  of credit  risk.  The  portion of the spread  that  compensates  for
interest rate risk would not typically  continue to be received by Farmer Mac if
the  asset  were  sold,  except  to the  extent  attributable  to  any  retained
interest-only strip.

     Expenses.  General and administrative expenses were $2.3 million for second
quarter 2005 and $4.3  million for the six months ended June 30, 2005,  compared
to $1.8 million and $3.9  million,  respectively,  for the same periods in 2004.
Compensation and employee benefits were $1.9 million for second quarter 2005 and
$3.7 million for the six months  ended June 30,  2005,  compared to $1.7 million
and $3.5 million,  respectively,  for the same periods in 2004.  Regulatory fees
assessed by FCA for second  quarter 2005 and 2004 were $0.6 million per quarter.
Regulatory  fees for the six  months  ended  June 30,  2005 were  $1.2  million,
compared  to  $1.1  million  for the six  months  ended  June  30,  2004.  FCA's
regulatory  fees  charged  to  Farmer  Mac for the  federal  fiscal  year  ended
September 30, 2004 were $2.0 million,  and FCA has advised the Corporation  that
its estimated fees for the federal fiscal year ending September 30, 2005 will be
$2.3 million.  After the end of a federal government fiscal year, FCA may revise
its prior year estimated  assessments to reflect actual costs incurred,  and has
issued both additional  assessments and refunds in the past.  Farmer Mac expects
all of the above-mentioned  expenses and regulatory fees to continue at or above
current levels through 2005.

     During  second  quarter  2005,  Farmer Mac  released  $0.3 million from the
allowance for losses,  compared to provisions of $1.6 million for second quarter
2004.  During  the six months  ended June 30,  2005,  Farmer Mac  released  $1.0
million from the allowance for losses, compared to provision of $3.2 million for
the six  months  ended  June  30,  2004.  See  "--Quantitative  and  Qualitative
Disclosures   About  Market  Risk   Management--Credit   Risk"  for   additional
information  regarding  Farmer Mac's provision for losses and provision for loan
losses.  As of June 30, 2005,  Farmer Mac's total  allowance for losses  totaled
$16.1  million,  or 0.37 percent of outstanding  loans held or loans  underlying
post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities and LTSPCs,  compared to $17.1
million and 0.37 percent as of December 31, 2004.

     Gains and Losses on Financial  Derivatives and Trading Assets.  The gain on
financial  derivatives  and trading  assets was $3.8 million for second  quarter
2005 and $2.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2005, compared to a loss
of $6.2 million and a loss of $2.9 million,  respectively,  for the same periods
in 2004.  The  gains in 2005 and the  losses  in 2004  resulted  primarily  from
fluctuations  in  the  fair  values  of  financial  derivatives  that  were  not
designated  as either fair value hedges or cash flow hedges in  accordance  with
SFAS 133, which fluctuations resulted from movements in interest rates.

     Non-GAAP Performance Measures.  Farmer Mac reports its financial results in
accordance with GAAP. In addition to GAAP measures,  Farmer Mac presents certain
non-GAAP  performance  measures.  Farmer  Mac uses  these  non-GAAP  performance
measures to develop financial plans, to measure corporate economic  performance,
and to set incentive  compensation  because,  in management's view, the non-GAAP
measures  provide a more  meaningful  representation  of Farmer  Mac's  economic
performance,  transaction  economics  and  business  trends.  Investors  and the
investment  analyst  community have previously  relied upon similar  measures to
evaluate  performance  and issue  projections.  These non-GAAP  disclosures  are
intended to supplement, not replace, GAAP information.

     Farmer Mac developed  non-GAAP core earnings to present net income less the
after-tax  effects of SFAS 133. Core earnings for the three and six months ended
June 30, 2005 were $6.0  million and $12.2  million,  respectively,  compared to
$6.2 million and $12.1 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2004.
The  reconciliation of GAAP net income available to common  stockholders to core
earnings is presented in the following table:

     Business  Volume.  New business  volume for second  quarter 2005 was $161.9
million,  up from $95.5  million in first  quarter  2005,  but down from  $189.3
million in second  quarter  2004.  Farmer Mac's new business  with  agricultural
mortgage lenders continues to be slowed by:

     o    reduced growth rates in the agricultural  mortgage market, due largely
          to the strong liquidity of many farmers and ranchers;
     o    high  levels  of  available  capital  and  liquidity  of  agricultural
          lenders;
     o    alternative sources of funding for agricultural lenders;
     o    increased   competition  in  the  secondary  market  for  agricultural
          mortgage loans; and
     o    adverse publicity about and increased regulatory pressure on GSEs.

Moreover, during second quarter 2005, Farmer Mac's new business with Farm Credit
System  institutions  was slowed by the  uncertainty  created by a proposed  FCA
regulation  concerning  risk-weighting of assets held by FCS institutions which,
if it had been adopted in its proposed  form,  could have decreased the value of
LTSPCs  and Farmer Mac swaps to those  institutions.  At its  meeting on May 12,
2005,  the FCA  adopted  a final  regulation  that  removed  the  risk-weighting
provisions for FCS institutions with respect to Farmer Mac transactions that had
been set forth in the proposed regulation.  Considering the other factors listed
above affecting the growth of Farmer Mac's business, it is uncertain whether the
action by FCA will result in additional FCS business with Farmer Mac.

      For a more detailed discussion of the above factors and the related
effects on Farmer Mac's business volume, see "Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Outlook for 2005" in
the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2004, filed with the SEC on March 16, 2005.

     Looking  ahead,  Farmer  Mac is  developing  innovative  ways to serve  the
financing needs of rural America,  and remains  confident of  opportunities  for
growth and increased  business volume as a result of the  Corporation's  product
development and customer service efforts. For example:

     o    In second quarter 2005,  Farmer Mac agreed to purchase or issue LTSPCs
          for loans secured by  agricultural  storage and processing  facilities
          aggregating  approximately  $105.4  million,   primarily  for  ethanol
          processing  facilities.  As of  June  30,  2005,  approximately  $79.1
          million of those loans were not yet closed or disbursed by the lender,
          though  those  events are  expected  to occur  during  third or fourth
          quarter 2005.
     o    In  second  quarter  2005,   Farmer  Mac  opened  a  satellite  credit
          underwriting  office in Ames,  Iowa to increase  the ease of access to
          Farmer Mac for  Midwestern  agricultural  lenders,  and  Farmer  Mac's
          responsiveness to them.
     o    On  July  29,  2005,  Farmer  Mac  and the  National  Rural  Utilities
          Cooperative  Finance Corporation ("CFC") jointly announced the sale by
          CFC and  purchase  by Farmer  Mac of $500  million of  three-year  CFC
          secured  notes.  The  notes,  which are  mission-related,  non-program
          investments  that  comply  with  parameters  established  by FCA,  are
          secured by mortgage  indebtedness  issued by CFC-member rural electric
          distribution  cooperatives  serving  communities across rural America.
          The  transaction  provided CFC with a new source of liquidity  for its
          rural utility  cooperative  members that serve rural  communities  and
          support  agriculture in 47 states, and advances Farmer Mac's financial
          role in and commitment to rural America.

Farmer Mac has diversified  its marketing focus to include large  securitization
transactions that emphasize net return on equity,  accepting lower  compensation
for the  assumption  of credit risk when  justified by higher asset  quality and
lower administrative costs.

     The  following  tables  set forth the amount of all Farmer Mac I and Farmer
Mac II loan purchase and guarantee  activities for newly  originated and current
seasoned loans during the periods indicated.

     The  decreases  in  defaulted   loans  purchased  and  in  defaulted  loans
transferred to loans reflect a reduction in newly  delinquent  loans  underlying
Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs.

     The  weighted-average  age of the Farmer Mac I newly originated and current
seasoned loans purchased  during second quarter 2005 and second quarter 2004 was
less than one month. Of the Farmer Mac I newly  originated and current  seasoned
loans  purchased  during second quarter 2005 and second quarter 2004, 77 percent
and 80 percent, respectively, had principal amortization periods longer than the
maturity   date,   resulting   in  balloon   payments   at   maturity,   with  a
weighted-average  remaining  term to  maturity  of 14.6  years  and 15.2  years,
respectively.  The  weighted-average  age of delinquent  loans  purchased out of
securitized  pools and LTSPCs during second quarter 2005 and second quarter 2004
was 13.7 years and 5.0 years, respectively.

     More than 250  lenders  were  actively  participating  either  directly  or
indirectly  in one or both of the Farmer Mac I or Farmer Mac II  programs  as of
June 30, 2005, with loans to approximately 20,000 borrowers.

     As of June 30, 2005,  there were 95 approved loan sellers in the Farmer Mac
I program  ranging from  single-office  to multi-branch  institutions,  spanning
community banks, Farm Credit System institutions, mortgage companies, commercial
banks and  insurance  companies.  The  reduction in the number of approved  loan
sellers  from  160  as  of  March  31,  2005  is   principally   the  result  of
decertification  by Farmer Mac of inactive  sellers.  During 2004, there were 59
approved  loan  sellers  active in the  Farmer  Mac I program.  In  addition  to
participating  directly in the Farmer Mac I program,  some of the approved  loan
sellers  enable  other  lenders to  participate  indirectly  in the Farmer Mac I
program by managing  correspondent  networks of lenders from which they purchase
loans to sell to Farmer Mac. As of June 30, 2005,  approximately 75 lenders were
participating in those networks.

     Any lender  authorized by the USDA to obtain a USDA guarantee on a loan may
be a seller in the Farmer Mac II program.  As of June 30,  2005,  there were 130
active sellers in the Farmer Mac II program,  compared to 133 as of December 31,
2004.  Sellers  in the Farmer Mac II program  consist  mostly of  community  and
regional banks.

     USDA's most recent  publications (as available on USDA's website as of July
29, 2005) forecast:

     o    2005 net cash  farm  income  to be $78.1  billion,  exceeding  the two
          successive  record years of $77.8 billion in 2004 and $68.6 billion in
          2003;
     o    2005 net farm income to be $64.4 billion,  which is a decrease of $9.2
          billion from the record  $73.6  billion  estimated  for 2004 but still
          $13.3 million higher than the 10-year average net farm income;
     o    Total  direct  government  payments  to be $24.1  billion in 2005,  an
          increase  from the 2004 estimate of $14.5  billion.  Market prices for
          crops affect payment rates for  countercyclical  government  programs.
          Under countercyclical  programs the level of payments varies inversely
          with market prices;  USDA anticipates  program crop prices to be lower
          in 2005,  due in part to large  inventories  from 2003 and 2004 bumper
          crops;
     o    The value of U.S.  farm real estate to increase 4.5 percent in 2005 to
          $1.23 trillion, a smaller increase as compared to the 2004 increase of
          5.4 percent.  USDA is anticipating  improvement in the general economy
          to support further growth in farmland values,  though at a rate slower
          than the average annual gain of 5.85 percent since 1999; and
     o    The amount of farm real estate debt to increase by 5.2 percent in 2005
          to $119.5 billion, up from $113.6 billion in 2004.

     The USDA forecast  components  referenced above relate to U.S.  agriculture
generally, but should be favorable for Farmer Mac's financial condition relative
to its exposure to  outstanding  guarantees  and  commitments,  as they indicate
strong  borrower cash flows,  and generally  increased  values in U.S. farm real
estate.

Balance Sheet Review

     During the six months ended June 30, 2005,  there were $91.1 million of net
principal  paydowns in program  assets  (Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities  and
loans) and a $86.6 million  increase in the  portfolio of investment  securities
and cash and cash equivalents. Consistent with the net decrease in assets during
the period, total liabilities  decreased $17.5 million from December 31, 2004 to
June 30, 2005.  For further  information  regarding  off-balance  sheet  program
activities, see "--Off-Balance Sheet Program Activities" below.

     During the six months ended June 30, 2005,  accumulated other comprehensive
income/(loss)  increased $1.3 million, which is the net effect of a $1.1 million
decrease in after-tax  unrealized  gains on securities  available for sale and a
$2.4  million  increase in the  after-tax  fair value of  financial  derivatives
classified as cash flow hedges. Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) is
not a component of Farmer Mac's core capital or regulatory capital.

     As of June 30,  2005,  Farmer Mac's core capital  totaled  $238.2  million,
compared to $237.7  million as of December 31, 2004.  As of June 30, 2005,  core
capital  exceeded Farmer Mac's statutory  minimum capital  requirement of $127.2
million by $111.0 million.

     Farmer Mac was in compliance  with its risk-based  capital  standards as of
June 30, 2005. As of June 30, 2005, the risk-based capital stress test generated
a regulatory  capital  requirement  of $49.6  million.  Farmer Mac's  regulatory
capital  of  $254.3  million  as of  June  30,  2005  exceeded  that  amount  by
approximately $204.7 million. The increase in the risk-based capital requirement
from  December 31, 2004 ($37.1  million) to June 30, 2005 ($49.6  million) was a
result of changes in the interest  rate  environment.  Farmer Mac is required to
hold capital at the higher of the statutory  minimum capital  requirement or the
amount required by the risk-based capital stress test.

Off-Balance Sheet Program Activities

     Farmer Mac offers  approved  agricultural  and rural  residential  mortgage
lenders two  off-balance  sheet  alternatives  to increase  their  liquidity  or
lending  capacity  while  retaining the cash flow  benefits of their loans:  (1)
Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities,  which are available through either the Farmer
Mac I program or the Farmer Mac II program,  and (2) LTSPCs, which are available
only  through  the Farmer Mac I program.  Both of these  alternatives  result in
off-balance  sheet  transactions  for Farmer  Mac.  See Note 3 to the  condensed
consolidated financial statements for further information regarding Farmer Mac's
off-balance sheet program activities.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Management

     Interest  Rate Risk.  Farmer Mac is  subject to  interest  rate risk on all
assets held for investment  because of possible  timing  differences in the cash
flows of the assets and related  liabilities.  This risk is primarily related to
loans held and on-balance sheet Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities because of the
ability of borrowers to prepay their mortgages before the scheduled  maturities,
thereby  increasing the risk of asset and liability cash flow  mismatches.  Cash
flow mismatches in a changing  interest rate environment can reduce the earnings
of the  Corporation  if assets repay sooner than expected and the resulting cash
flows must be reinvested in lower-yielding investments when Farmer Mac's funding
costs  cannot be  correspondingly  reduced,  or if assets repay more slowly than
expected and the associated debt must be replaced by higher-cost debt.

     Yield maintenance  provisions and other prepayment  penalties  contained in
many agricultural  mortgage loans reduce, but do not eliminate,  this prepayment
risk,  particularly in the case of a defaulted loan where yield  maintenance may
not be  collected.  Those  provisions  require  borrowers to make an  additional
payment when they prepay their loans so that,  when  reinvested with the prepaid
principal, yield maintenance payments generate substantially the same cash flows
that would have been generated had the loan not prepaid. Those provisions create
a disincentive  to prepayment and  compensate the  Corporation  for its interest
rate risks to a large degree. As of June 30, 2005, 57 percent of the outstanding
balance of all loans held and loans  underlying  on-balance  sheet  Farmer Mac I
Guaranteed  Securities  (including  80 percent of all loans with fixed  interest
rates)  were  covered  by yield  maintenance  provisions  and  other  prepayment
penalties. Of the Farmer Mac I new and current loans purchased in second quarter
2005, 7 percent had yield maintenance or another form of prepayment  protection.
As of June 30, 2005, none of the USDA-guaranteed  portions underlying Farmer Mac
II Guaranteed Securities had yield maintenance  provisions;  however, 14 percent
contained  prepayment  penalties.  Of the USDA-guaranteed  portions purchased in
second quarter 2005, less than one percent contained prepayment penalties.

     As of June  30,  2005,  Farmer  Mac had  $390.1  million  of cash  and cash
equivalents  and $1.2 billion of investment  securities.  Cash  equivalents  and
investment securities pose only limited interest rate risk to Farmer Mac, due to
their closely matched funding. Farmer Mac's cash equivalents mature within three
months and are match-funded with discount notes having similar maturities. As of
June 30, 2005,  Farmer Mac's investment  securities  consisted of $843.3 million
(71.3  percent) of floating rate  securities  that have rates that adjust within
one year. These floating rate investments are funded using:

     o    a series of discount note issuances in which each successive  discount
          note is issued and matures on or about the corresponding interest rate
          reset date of the related investment;
     o    floating-rate  notes  having  similar  rate  reset  provisions  as the
          related investment; or
     o    fixed-rate  notes  swapped to  floating  rates  having  similar  reset
          provisions as the related investment.

     The most  comprehensive  stress test of Farmer Mac's  exposure to long-term
interest rate risk is the  sensitivity  of its Market Value of Equity ("MVE") to
yield curve shocks.  MVE  represents  the present value of all future cash flows
from on- and off-balance  sheet assets,  liabilities and financial  derivatives,
discounted  at  current  interest  rates and  spreads.  The  following  schedule
summarizes the results of Farmer Mac's MVE  sensitivity  analysis as of June 30,
2005 and December 31, 2004 to an immediate and  instantaneous  parallel shift in
the yield curve.

</TABLE>

     During second  quarter 2005,  Farmer Mac maintained a low level of interest
rate sensitivity through ongoing asset and liability management  activities.  As
of June 30,  2005,  a uniform or  "parallel"  increase of 100 basis points would
have  increased  NII, a  shorter-term  measure  of  interest  rate risk,  by 3.3
percent,  while a parallel decrease of 100 basis points would have decreased NII
by 3.3 percent.  Farmer Mac also measures the sensitivity of both MVE and NII to
a variety  of  non-parallel  interest  rate  shocks,  including  flattening  and
steepening yield curve  scenarios.  As of June 30, 2005, both MVE and NII showed
similar or lesser sensitivity to non-parallel  shocks as to the parallel shocks.
As of June 30, 2005,  Farmer Mac's  effective  duration  gap,  another  standard
measure  of  interest  rate  risk  that  measures  the  difference  between  the
sensitivities  of assets compared to that of  liabilities,  was plus 1.1 months,
compared to plus 0.4 months as of December 31, 2004.  Duration matching helps to
maintain the correlation of cash flows and stable  portfolio  earnings even when
interest rates are not stable.  The relative  insensitivity  of Farmer Mac's MVE
and NII to both parallel and non-parallel interest rate shocks, and its duration
gap, indicate the  effectiveness of the  Corporation's  approach to managing its
interest rate risk exposures.

     As of June 30, 2005,  Farmer Mac had $1.4 billion combined  notional amount
of interest rate swaps with terms ranging from 1 to 15 years.  Of those interest
rate swaps,  $636.6  million were  floating-to-fixed  rate  interest rate swaps,
$155.0  million were  fixed-to-floating  interest rate swaps and $657.4  million
were basis swaps.

     Farmer Mac uses financial  derivatives as an end-user for hedging purposes,
not for trading or speculative  purposes.  When financial  derivatives  meet the
specific  hedge  criteria  under SFAS 133, they are accounted for as either fair
value  hedges or cash flow  hedges.  Financial  derivatives  that do not satisfy
those hedge  criteria  are not  accounted  for as hedges and changes in the fair
value of those financial derivatives are reported as a gain or loss on financial
derivatives and trading assets in the consolidated statements of operations. All
of Farmer Mac's financial  derivative  transactions are conducted under standard
collateralized  agreements that limit Farmer Mac's potential  credit exposure to
any counterparty.  As of June 30, 2005, Farmer Mac had no  uncollateralized  net
exposure to any counterparty.

     Credit Risk.  Farmer Mac's  primary  exposure to credit risk is the risk of
loss  resulting  from the  inability of  borrowers  to repay their  mortgages in
conjunction  with a deficiency  in the value of the  collateral  relative to the
amount outstanding on the mortgage and the costs of liquidation.  Farmer Mac has
established underwriting, appraisal and documentation standards for Farmer Mac I
agricultural  mortgage loans to mitigate the risk of loss from borrower defaults
and to provide guidance concerning the management, administration and conduct of
underwriting and appraisals to all  participating  sellers and potential sellers
in its programs.

     Farmer Mac's  allowance  for losses is presented in four  components on its
consolidated balance sheet:

     o    an "Allowance for loan losses" on loans held for investment;
     o    a valuation  allowance on real estate owned,  which is included in the
          balance sheet under "Real estate owned, net of valuation allowance";
     o    a  "Contingent  obligation  for probable  losses" on loans  underlying
          post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities  and LTSPCs  entered
          into or modified  after  January 1, 2003,  for which  inherent  losses
          existed  at the  time of the  guarantee  or  commitment  and  could be
          reasonably estimated, is included in the balance sheet as a portion of
          the amount reported as "Guarantee and commitment obligation"; and
     o    an allowance for losses on loans underlying post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I
          Guaranteed  Securities  and  LTSPCs,  which is included in the balance
          sheet under "Reserve for losses."

     Farmer Mac's  provision  for losses is presented in two  components  on its
consolidated statement of operations:

     o    a "Provision for loan losses," which represents losses on Farmer Mac's
          loans held for investment; and
     o    a "Provision for losses," which represents  losses on loans underlying
          post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities  and LTSPCs and real
          estate owned.

     Farmer Mac estimates probable losses using a systematic process that begins
with  management's  evaluation  of the  results  of its  proprietary  loan  pool
simulation  and  guarantee  fee  model  (the  "Model").  The  Model  draws  upon
historical  information from a data set of agricultural  mortgage loans recorded
over a longer period of time than Farmer Mac's own experience to date,  screened
to include  only those  loans with  credit  characteristics  similar to those on
which Farmer Mac has assumed credit risk. The results generated by the Model are
modified by the  application of management's  judgment,  as required to take key
factors into account, including:

     o    economic conditions;
     o    geographic and agricultural commodity/product concentrations in Farmer
          Mac's portfolio;
     o    the credit profile of Farmer Mac's portfolio;
     o    delinquency trends of Farmer Mac's portfolio;
     o    Farmer  Mac's  experience  in the  management  and sale of real estate
          owned; and
     o    historical   charge-off  and  recovery   activities  of  Farmer  Mac's
          portfolio.

Management  believes  that  its  use of this  methodology  produces  a  reliable
estimate of total probable  losses,  as of the balance sheet date, for all loans
included in Farmer Mac's portfolio,  including loans held, real estate owned and
loans  underlying  post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities and LTSPCs.
Farmer Mac's  methodology  for determining its allowance for losses will migrate
over time away from the Model,  to become based on Farmer  Mac's own  historical
portfolio loss experience.  Until that time, Farmer Mac will continue to use the
results from the Model,  augmented by the application of management's  judgment,
to determine its allowance for losses.

     Management  believes that the general  allowance,  which is the  difference
between the total allowance for losses (generated  through use of the Model) and
the specific  allowances,  adequately covers any probable losses inherent in the
portfolio of performing loans under Statement of Financial  Accounting Standards
No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies ("SFAS 5").

     The  following  table  summarizes  the changes in the  components of Farmer
Mac's  allowance for losses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2005 and
2004:

     During  second  quarter  2005,  Farmer Mac  released  $0.3 million from the
allowance for losses,  compared to provisions of $1.6 million for second quarter
2004.  During  second  quarter  2005,  Farmer Mac  charged off $15,000 in losses
against  the  allowance  for  losses  and  had  $42,000  in  recoveries  for net
recoveries of $27,000.  During second quarter 2004,  Farmer Mac charged off $2.0
million in losses  against the  allowance  for losses and received  $1.8 million
from  two  sellers  (one  of  which  was  a  related   party)  for  breaches  of
representations  and  warranties  associated  with prior  sales of  agricultural
mortgage loans to Farmer Mac, which amount Farmer Mac previously  charged off as
losses on the associated loans. These recoveries were reported as representation
and warranty claims income on the statements of operations and are not reflected
in the net  charge-offs  for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2004
presented above.  There was no previously  accrued or advanced interest on loans
or Farmer Mac I  Guaranteed  Securities  that was charged off in second  quarter
2005 or second  quarter  2004. As of June 30, 2005,  Farmer Mac's  allowance for
losses totaled $16.1 million,  or 37 basis points of the  outstanding  principal
balance of loans held and loans underlying post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed
Securities  and  LTSPCs,  compared  to $17.1  million  (37 basis  points)  as of
December 31, 2004.

     As of June 30,  2005,  Farmer  Mac's  90-day  delinquencies  totaled  $36.8
million and represented 0.85 percent of the principal  balance of all loans held
and loans  underlying  post-1996  Act Farmer  Mac I  Guaranteed  Securities  and
LTSPCs, compared to $32.8 million (0.68 percent) as of June 30, 2004. As of June
30,  2005,   Farmer  Mac's   non-performing   assets  (which   includes   90-day
delinquencies,  loans  performing  under either their  original  loan terms or a
court-approved bankruptcy plan, and real estate owned) totaled $60.7 million and
represented  1.39 percent of the  principal  balance of all loans held and loans
underlying post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs, compared
to $69.8  million  (1.43  percent)  as of June 30,  2004.  Loans  that have been
restructured  after  delinquency were  insignificant and are included within the
reported 90-day delinquency and non-performing  asset disclosures.  From quarter
to quarter,  Farmer Mac anticipates that 90-day delinquencies and non-performing
assets will  fluctuate,  both in dollars and as a percentage of the  outstanding
portfolio,  with higher levels likely at the end of the first and third quarters
of each year corresponding to the semi-annual (January 1st and July 1st) payment
characteristics of most Farmer Mac I loans.

     The following table presents historical  information regarding Farmer Mac's
non-performing assets and 90-day delinquencies:

     As of June 30, 2005,  approximately  $1.2 billion (28.4  percent) of Farmer
Mac's  outstanding  loans held and loans  underlying  post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I
Guaranteed  Securities  and LTSPCs  were in their peak  delinquency  and default
years  (approximately  years three through five after origination),  compared to
$1.6 billion (32.2  percent) of such loans as of June 30, 2004.  The Model takes
the portfolio age distribution and maturation into  consideration.  Accordingly,
those trends did not cause  management to alter the Model's  projection  for the
provisions for losses.

     As of June 30,  2005,  Farmer Mac  analyzed  its $90.9  million of impaired
assets for collateral shortfalls against updated appraised values, other updated
collateral  valuations  or  discounted  values.  Of the $90.9  million of assets
analyzed, $84.4 million were adequately collateralized.  For the $6.5 million of
assets that were not adequately collateralized, individual collateral shortfalls
totaled $0.8 million.  Accordingly,  Farmer Mac recorded specific  allowances of
$0.8 million to those  under-collateralized  assets as of June 30,  2005.  As of
June   30,   2005,   after   the   allocation   of   specific    allowances   to
under-collateralized  loans,  Farmer Mac had additional  non-specific or general
allowances of $15.3  million,  bringing the total  allowance for losses to $16.1
million.

     As of June 30, 2005, the weighted-average  original  loan-to-value  ("LTV")
ratio for all  loans  held and  loans  underlying  post-1996  Act  Farmer  Mac I
Guaranteed  Securities  and  LTSPCs  was 50  percent,  and the  weighted-average
original LTV ratio for all post-1996 Act non-performing assets was 56 percent.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

     Farmer Mac has  sufficient  liquidity and capital  resources to support its
operations  for the next twelve  months and has a  contingency  funding  plan to
handle unanticipated disruptions in its access to the capital markets.

     Debt Issuance.  Section 8.6(e) of Farmer Mac's statutory charter (12 U.S.C.
ss.  2279aa-6(e))  authorizes  Farmer Mac to issue debt  obligations to purchase
eligible  mortgage  loans and Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities and to maintain
reasonable amounts for business operations, including adequate liquidity. Farmer
Mac funds its  program  operations  primarily  by issuing  debt  obligations  of
various maturities in the public capital markets.  Farmer Mac's debt obligations
consist of discount notes and medium-term notes,  including floating rate notes,
issued to obtain funds  principally to cover the costs of purchasing and holding
loans and securities  (including Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities).  Farmer Mac
also issues discount notes and medium-term  notes to obtain funds to finance its
investments, transaction costs, guarantee payments and LTSPC payments.

     The interest and  principal on Farmer Mac's debt are not  guaranteed by and
do not constitute debts or obligations of FCA or the United States or any agency
or  instrumentality of the United States other than Farmer Mac. Farmer Mac is an
institution  of the  Farm  Credit  System,  but is not  liable  for any  debt or
obligation of any other institution of the Farm Credit System. Likewise, neither
the Farm Credit System nor any other  individual  institution of the Farm Credit
System  is  liable  for any debt or  obligation  of  Farmer  Mac.  Income to the
purchaser of a Farmer Mac discount note or medium-term  note is not exempt under
federal law from federal,  state or local taxation.  The Corporation's  discount
notes and medium-term  notes are not currently rated by a nationally  recognized
statistical rating organization (NRSRO).

     Farmer Mac's board of directors has  authorized  the issuance of up to $5.0
billion of  discount  notes and  medium-term  notes (of which $3.5  billion  was
outstanding as of June 30, 2005),  subject to periodic review of the adequacy of
that level relative to Farmer Mac's borrowing  requirements.  Farmer Mac invests
the proceeds of such issuances in loans,  Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities and
non-program  investment assets in accordance with guidelines  established by its
board of directors.

     In July 2005,  Farmer Mac formed a global debt  program to  facilitate  the
funding of future  business  growth  opportunities  and issued  $500  million of
three-year  fixed rate notes under the program on August 2, 2005.  That issue of
notes is listed on the New York Stock  Exchange.  Farmer Mac is applying to list
notes issued under its global debt program on the London Stock Exchange.

     Liquidity.  The  funding  and  liquidity  needs of  Farmer  Mac's  business
programs are driven by the purchase and  retention of eligible  loans and Farmer
Mac  Guaranteed  Securities,  the  maturities of Farmer Mac's discount notes and
medium-term notes and payment of principal and interest on Farmer Mac Guaranteed
Securities. Farmer Mac's primary sources of funds to meet these needs are:

     o    principal and interest  payments and ongoing  guarantee and commitment
          fees received on loans, Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs;
     o    principal and interest payments  received from investment  securities;
          and
     o    the issuance of new discount notes and medium-term notes.

     As a result  of  Farmer  Mac's  regular  issuance  of  discount  notes  and
medium-term notes and its status as a federally chartered instrumentality of the
United  States,  Farmer  Mac has been  able to access  the  capital  markets  at
favorable rates. Farmer Mac has also used floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps,
combined with discount note issuances,  as a source of fixed-rate funding. While
the swap market may provide  favorable  fixed rates,  swap  transactions  expose
Farmer Mac to the risk of future  widening of its own  issuance  spreads  versus
corresponding  LIBOR rates. If the spreads on the Farmer Mac discount notes were
to  increase  relative to LIBOR,  Farmer Mac would be exposed to a  commensurate
reduction   on  its  net  interest   yield  on  the   notional   amount  of  its
floating-to-fixed  interest  rate  swaps and  other  LIBOR-based  floating  rate
assets.

     Farmer Mac  maintains a  liquidity  investment  portfolio  of cash and cash
equivalents  (including  commercial  paper and  other  short-term  money  market
instruments)  and  investment  securities  consisting  mostly of  floating  rate
securities  with rates that adjust within one year,  which can be drawn upon for
liquidity needs. As of June 30, 2005, Farmer Mac's cash and cash equivalents and
investment  securities  were $390.1 million and $1.2 billion,  respectively.  In
addition,  as of June 30, 2005,  Farmer Mac held a $740.0  million  portfolio of
Farmer Mac II  Guaranteed  Securities  backed by  USDA-guaranteed  portions that
carry the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. As of June 30, 2005, the
aggregate  of  the  Farmer  Mac  II  Guaranteed  Securities  and  the  liquidity
investment portfolio  represented 64.4 percent of total liabilities.  Farmer Mac
has a policy of maintaining a minimum of 60 days of liquidity and a target of 90
days of liquidity.  For second quarter 2005, Farmer Mac maintained an average of
greater than 90 days of liquidity.

     Capital.  During second quarter 2005, Farmer Mac repurchased 272,988 shares
of its Class C Non-Voting  Common Stock at an average  price of $18.36 per share
pursuant to the  Corporation's  previously  announced stock repurchase  program.
These  repurchases  reduced  the  Corporation's  capital by  approximately  $5.0
million.  During the six  months  ended June 30,  2005,  Farmer Mac  repurchased
564,442  shares of its Class C Non-Voting  Common  Stock at an average  price of
$19.38 leading to reduction in capital of approximately $11.0 million.

Regulatory Matters

     During second  quarter 2005,  FCA approved a final  regulation  relating to
Farmer Mac's investments and liquidity. FCA included several of the revisions to
the proposed regulation  suggested by Farmer Mac in comments to the proposal and
Farmer Mac  expects  to be able to comply  with the  regulation  when it becomes
effective. FCA has not announced the effective date of the regulation, but it is
expected to become effective during the last week of September 2005.  Farmer Mac
is required to comply with the liquidity  provisions of the regulation within 24
months of the effective date.

Other Matters

     In fourth quarter 2004, first quarter 2005 and second quarter 2005,  Farmer
Mac paid a  quarterly  dividend  of $0.10 per share on the  Corporation's  three
classes of common stock - Class A Voting  Common  Stock,  Class B Voting  Common
Stock, and Class C Non-Voting  Common Stock.  Each dividend was paid on the last
day of each  quarter  to  holders  of  record as of the 15th day of the month in
which the dividend was paid. On August 4, 2005,  Farmer Mac's board of directors
declared a  quarterly  dividend  of $0.10 per share on the  Corporation's  three
classes of common stock payable on September 30, 2005 to holders of record as of
September 15, 2005.  Farmer Mac expects to continue to pay comparable  quarterly
cash dividends for the foreseeable future,  subject to the outlook and indicated
capital  needs  of  the  Corporation  and  the  determination  of the  board  of
directors. Farmer Mac's ability to declare and pay dividends could be restricted
if it  were  to  fail  to  comply  with  regulatory  capital  requirements.  See
"Business--Government     Regulation    of    Farmer    Mac--Regulation--Capital
Standards--Enforcement  levels" in Farmer Mac's  Annual  Report on Form 10-K for
the fiscal year ended  December 31, 2004.  Farmer Mac's ability to pay dividends
on its  common  stock  is  also  subject  to the  payment  of  dividends  on its
outstanding preferred stock.

information  required to be disclosed  under the Exchange Act is accumulated and
communicated  to  the  Corporation's  management  on a  timely  basis  to  allow
decisions  regarding required  disclosure.  Farmer Mac's Chief Executive Officer

in Farmer Mac's  internal  control over financial  reporting  during the quarter
