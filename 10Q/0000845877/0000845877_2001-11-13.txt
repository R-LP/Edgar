</TABLE>


          (d) Reclassifications

      Certain reclassifications of prior period information were made to conform
to the current period presentation.

          (e) New Accounting Standards

     As amended, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting
for Derivative  Instruments and Hedging Activities ("SFAS 133") became effective
as of January 1, 2001.  SFAS 133 requires  financial  derivatives to be measured
and recorded at fair value.  Pursuant to generally accepted accounting practices
prior to SFAS 133, derivatives were accounted for as off-balance sheet items and
disclosed in the consolidated financial statement footnotes.

     The cumulative effect of this change in accounting principles recognized on
January  1, 2001 was a  reduction  to net  income  of  $726,000  and a  negative
adjustment to other  comprehensive  income within  stockholders'  equity of $8.6
million.  As part of the  implementation  of SFAS 133,  Farmer Mac  reclassified
certain  investments  from held to maturity and available for sale securities to
trading  securities.  The  Corporation  expects  that  SFAS  133  will  increase
volatility in earnings and accumulated other comprehensive income.

     In  September  2000,  the  Financial   Accounting  Standards  Board  issued
Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 140,  Accounting for Transfers
and Servicing of Financial  Assets and  Extinguishments  of  Liabilities  ("SFAS
140").  SFAS 140 was applied as of April 1, 2001 as  required  by the  standard.
SFAS 140 does not materially affect the  Corporation's  results of operations or
financial  position,  but does result in the  Corporation  classifying  as loans
certain  AMBS  that  were   previously   classified  as  Farmer  Mac  guaranteed
securities.

            (f)   Financial Derivatives

     Farmer Mac enters  into  derivative  instruments  as an  end-user,  not for
speculative purposes. Farmer Mac enters into interest-rate contracts,  including
interest-rate swaps and caps, to adjust the characteristics of Farmer Mac's debt
to match more  closely the  characteristics  of the  Corporation's  assets or to
provide better returns on its  investments.  Farmer Mac enters into forward sale
contracts of GSE debt and  mortgage-backed  securities  and U.S.  Treasury based
futures  contracts  to  manage  interest-rate  risk  exposure  related  to  loan
purchases and anticipated debt issuances.

     Interest-rate  swaps used to hedge corporate debt investments,  and forward
sale  contracts  used to hedge Farmer Mac's loan  portfolio,  are classified and
accounted  for as fair  value  hedges.  Interest-rate  swaps  and  forward  sale
contracts used to hedge  anticipated debt issuances are classified and accounted
for as cash flow  hedges.  Other  financial  derivatives,  such as  futures  and
interest-rate  caps, are not assigned an accounting  hedge  designation.  Farmer
Mac's  financial  derivatives  are carried at their fair values.  For fair value
hedges,  the  changes  in the fair  values of the  derivatives,  along  with the
changes in fair values of the hedged items,  are recorded in earnings.  For cash
flow hedges,  the changes in the fair values of the  derivatives are recorded in
other  comprehensive  income  and  any  hedge  ineffectiveness  is  recorded  in
earnings.   For  derivative   instruments  not  assigned  an  accounting   hedge
designation,  the changes in fair value are recorded in earnings.  Net after-tax
charges  against  earnings  under SFAS 133 during  third  quarter  2001  totaled
$190,000,  and the net after-tax decrease to other comprehensive  income totaled
$14.1 million. Substantially all of this amount represents the estimated present
value  of the  cost of  settled  forward  sale  contracts  and the net  interest
payments on interest-rate swap contracts,  using fair values as of September 30,
2001, and assuming no change in interest  rates.  Farmer Mac estimates that $2.6
million of the amount  currently  reported in  accumulated  other  comprehensive
income will be  reclassified  into earnings  within the next twelve months.  The
Corporation  entered into those  interest-rate  swap contracts to derive a lower
effective  fixed-rate cost of borrowing for periods of up to 15 years than would
otherwise  have been  available  to the  Corporation  in the  conventional  debt
market.  For the quarter  ended  September  30,  2001,  the  ineffectiveness  of
designated hedges included in Farmer Mac's net income was immaterial.

Note 2.  Off-Balance Sheet Guaranteed Securities

     For  information  regarding the  off-balance  sheet risks  associated  with
Farmer Mac's  guarantees of AMBS, see  "Management's  Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Management - Credit Risk."

Note 3.  Comprehensive Income

     Comprehensive  income  (loss) is comprised of net income plus other changes
in  stockholders'  equity not resulting from  investments by or distributions to
stockholders. The following table sets forth comprehensive income (loss) for the
three and nine  months  ended  September  30,  2001 and  2000.  The  changes  in
unrealized  gains  on  securities  available-for-sale  are  net of  the  related
deferred  tax expense of $15.1  million and $2.7  million for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2001, respectively,  and deferred tax expense of $1.8
million and $1.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2000,
respectively.  The change in the fair value of financial derivatives  classified
as cash flow hedges for the three and nine months  ended  September  30, 2001 is
net of the  related  deferred  tax  benefit of $7.8  million  and $7.9  million,
respectively.

Item 2. Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
        of Operations


Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

     Certain statements made in this Form 10-Q are "forward-looking  statements"
within the meaning of the Private Securities  Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that
reflect  management's  current  expectations  for Farmer Mac's future  financial
results,   business   prospects  and  business   developments.   Forward-looking
statements  include,  without  limitation,   any  statement  that  may  predict,
forecast,  indicate or imply future results,  performance or  achievements,  and
typically are accompanied by, and identified with, such terms as  "anticipates,"
"believes,"  "estimates,"  "expects,"  "intends,"  "plans," "should" and similar
expressions.   The  following  management's  discussion  and  analysis  includes
forward-looking  statements  addressing  Farmer Mac's prospects for earnings and
growth in loan  purchase,  guarantee and  securitization  volume;  trends in net
interest  income,  delinquencies  and provision  for losses;  changes in capital
position;  and other business and financial matters.  Management's  expectations
for  Farmer  Mac's  future  necessarily  involve  a number  of  assumptions  and
estimates and the  evaluation  of risks and  uncertainties.  Various  factors or
events could cause Farmer Mac's  actual  results to differ  materially  from the
expectations  as  expressed  or  implied  by  the  forward-looking   statements,
including:  uncertainties regarding the rate and direction of development of the
secondary  market  for  agricultural  mortgage  loans;  substantial  changes  in
interest rates, the agricultural  economy  (including  agricultural land values,
commodity  prices,  export  demand for U.S.  agricultural  products  and federal
assistance to farmers) or the general economy;  uncertainties as to the intended
operation of the new risk-based capital standard  promulgated by the Farm Credit
Administration, which Farmer Mac is required to comply with by May 23, 2002; the
implementation of additional statutory or regulatory  restrictions applicable to
Farmer Mac or  restrictions  on Farmer Mac's  investment  authority;  protracted
adverse weather,  market or other  conditions  affecting  particular  geographic
regions or particular commodities related to agricultural mortgage loans backing
Farmer Mac  guaranteed  securities;  legislative or regulatory  developments  or
interpretations  of Farmer Mac's statutory  charter that could adversely  affect
Farmer Mac or the ability of certain  lenders to  participate in its programs or
the  terms  of any such  participation;  the  availability  of debt  funding  in
sufficient  quantities and at favorable rates to support continued  growth;  the
rate  of  growth  in  agricultural  mortgage  indebtedness;   the  size  of  the
agricultural mortgage market;  borrower preferences for fixed-rate  agricultural
mortgage indebtedness;  the willingness of lenders to sell agricultural mortgage
loans into the Farmer Mac  secondary  market;  the  willingness  of investors to
invest  in   agricultural   mortgage-backed   securities;   competition  in  the
origination  or  purchase  of  agricultural  mortgage  loans  and  the  sale  of
agricultural  mortgage-backed  and debt  securities;  or changes in Farmer Mac's
status as a government-sponsored enterprise.

     The foregoing factors are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report may
include additional factors that could adversely affect Farmer Mac's business and
its financial  performance.  Furthermore,  new risk factors  emerge from time to
time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor
assess the  effects of such  factors on Farmer  Mac's  business or the extent to
which any factor, or combination of factors,  may cause actual results to differ
materially  from the  expectations  expressed or implied by the  forward-looking
statements.  Given these  potential risks and  uncertainties,  no undue reliance
should be placed on any  forward-looking  statements  expressed  in this report.
Furthermore, Farmer Mac undertakes no obligation to release publicly the results
of revisions to any  forward-looking  statements that may be made to reflect any
future events or circumstances.

Results of Operations

     Operating  Results.  SFAS 133  requires  the  change in the fair  values of
certain financial derivatives to be reflected in the Corporation's net income or
other  comprehensive  income.  Management  believes  that  reporting  results by
reference to operating income and operating  revenues,  excluding the cumulative
effect of the  change in  accounting  principles  recognized  on January 1, 2001
under SFAS 133 and its ongoing  effects during the reporting  periods,  provides
meaningful  operating  measures  of Farmer  Mac's  financial  performance.  Such
information is presented to supplement,  not replace, net income, revenues, cash
from  operations,  or any other  operating  or  liquidity  performance  measures
prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles.

     Overview.  Net income for third quarter 2001,  including the cumulative and
ongoing  effects of SFAS 133 during the  quarter,  was $4.9 million or $0.41 per
share.  Net income for third  quarter  2000 was $2.7 million or $0.24 per share.
Net  income for the nine  months  ended  September  30,  2001 was $10.8  million
compared to $7.6 million for the nine months  ended  September  30,  2000.  This
represents  a 71 percent  increase  in net income  per share.  Operating  income
totaled $5.0 million for third  quarter  2001,  or $0.42 per share,  compared to
$2.7 million,  or $0.24 per share, for third quarter 2000.  Operating income for
the nine months ended September 30, 2001 was $12.3 million,  or $1.01 per share,
compared  to $7.6  million,  or  $0.66  per  share,  for the nine  months  ended
September 30, 2000.

     Farmer Mac's revenue growth continued in third quarter 2001, reflecting the
effects of outstanding  guarantee  volume as of September 30, 2001 that was more
than $1 billion  higher than at the close of third quarter 2000 and net interest
income earned on higher  average  interest-earning  asset  balances that were 82
percent higher than during third quarter 2000. During third quarter 2001, Farmer
Mac (1) purchased  $42.4 million of guaranteed  portions of loans  guaranteed by
the United  States  Department of  Agriculture  ("USDA"),  (2)  purchased  $69.6
million of Farmer Mac I loans and (3) added $246.5 million in long-term  standby
purchase commitments.

     Farmer Mac's  outstanding  guarantee  volume increased during third quarter
2001 despite  continued  unfavorable  economic  conditions  in the  agricultural
sector. Weak market opportunities for agricultural  commodities and products and
low commodity prices have persisted  throughout 2001. Total direct  governmental
payments  to the  agricultural  sector for 2000 as  reported  by the USDA were a
record $22.9  billion.  Although the USDA  forecast for 2001  reflects  slightly
lower  government  payments of $20.0 billion,  the decline is primarily due to a
$2.5 billion reduction in deficiency payments resulting from higher crop prices.
Overall,  USDA is forecasting  net cash income on farms at $60.8  billion,  or 6
percent above the 2000 level and  substantially  above the 1990-2000  average of
$55.0 billion.  Nationwide,  USDA currently forecasts farm real estate values to
rise during 2001 to $932.9 billion, up slightly over 2000. Regionally, farm real
estate  values may vary with  differing  rates of increase,  or even  decreases,
depending on commodities  grown and regional  economic  factors.  As unfavorable
economic conditions in the agricultural  sector persist,  Farmer Mac has focused
its marketing  efforts on increasing  awareness of the significance of its brand
name and building relationships among agricultural lenders.  Although Farmer Mac
believes it is positioned well in the marketplace and that its planned marketing
strategies  for the  remainder  of 2001 and the first half of 2002 will  produce
portfolio  transactions in the coming  quarters,  the timing and total volume of
those transactions is uncertain at this time.

     During second quarter 2001,  Farmer Mac, at the request of the  Agriculture
Committees in both the Senate and House of Representatives,  presented testimony
in connection with Congress'  consideration of the  reauthorization  of the farm
bill. In that testimony and in discussions  with Committee  staff and others who
expressed  interest in Farmer Mac's suggestion,  the Corporation  suggested that
Congress consider adding the authority to establish a secondary market for rural
development  loans to the Corporation's  authorities.  At this time, there is no
legislation  being  considered  by Congress  that  includes a rural  development
secondary market proposal.

     Set forth below is a more  detailed  discussion  of Farmer Mac's results of
operations.

     Net Interest Income. Net interest income was $7.9 million for third quarter
2001 and $19.7 million year-to-date,  compared to $4.3 million and $13.2 million
for the same periods in 2000. The strength in the net interest yield is a result
of continued  emphasis on sound interest rate risk  management and debt issuance
strategies  and a $781,000  increase  from the income  recognition  due to yield
maintenance  payments received in conjunction with borrower  prepayments  during
year-to-date  2001. The income realized from yield  maintenance  payments is, in
effect, the accelerated present value of an expected future income stream which,
in turn,  leads to slightly  reduced  net  interest  income in future  reporting
periods.  The timing and size of these  payments  varies  greatly  and, as such,
variations should not be considered indicative of positive or negative trends to
gauge  future  financial  results.  The  following  table  provides  information
regarding the average balances and rates of interest-earning  assets and funding
for the nine months ended September 30, 2001 and 2000.

     Other Income.  Other income, which is comprised of guarantee fee income and
miscellaneous  income,  totaled  $4.3  million for third  quarter 2001 and $11.7
million  for  year-to-date  2001,  compared to $3.1  million  and $8.6  million,
respectively,  in 2000.  Guarantee  fee income,  the largest  component of other
income,  was $4.2 million for third quarter  2001,  compared to $3.0 million for
third quarter 2000.  The relative  increase in guarantee fee income  reflects an
increase in the average balance of outstanding guarantees.  Miscellaneous income
was $137,000 for third quarter 2001, compared to $78,000 for third quarter 2000.

     Expenses.  During  third  quarter  2001,  operating  expenses  totaled $2.5
million,  compared to $2.1 million for third quarter 2000. Operating expenses as
a  percentage  of operating  revenues  were 21 percent for third  quarter  2001,
compared to 28 percent for third quarter 2000.

     Farmer Mac's  provision for principal and interest  losses was $2.0 million
for third quarter 2001 and $4.7 million for year-to-date 2001,  compared to $1.1
million and $3.4 million for the same periods in 2000. As of September 30, 2001,
Farmer  Mac's  reserve for losses  totaled  $14.7  million,  or 0.44  percent of
outstanding  post-1996 Act loans and AMBS,  compared to $10.0  million,  or 0.43
percent, as of September 30, 2000.

     The provision for income taxes totaled $2.5 million for second quarter 2001
and $6.1 million year-to-date, compared to $1.5 million and $4.2 million for the
same periods in 2000. Farmer Mac's effective tax rate for third quarter 2001 was
33.3 percent  compared to 35.5 percent for third quarter 2000.  The reduction in
the effective rate for reflects the effects of certain tax-advantaged investment
securities.

</TABLE>


     See  "Overview"  above  for a  discussion  regarding  loans  purchased  and
guaranteed by Farmer Mac.

     Indicators of future loan  purchase  volume in the  immediately  succeeding
reporting period include outstanding commitments to purchase loans and the total
balance of loans submitted for approval or approved but not yet purchased.  Many
purchase   commitments  entered  into  by  Farmer  Mac  are  mandatory  delivery
commitments. If a seller obtains a mandatory commitment and is unable to deliver
the loans as required thereunder, Farmer Mac requires the seller to pay a fee to
modify, extend or cancel the commitment.  As of September 30, 2001,  outstanding
commitments  to purchase or guarantee  Farmer Mac I loans totaled $19.0 million,
compared to $11.0  million as of September  30, 2000.  Of the total Farmer Mac I
commitments  outstanding  as of September  30, 2001 and 2000,  $15.8 million and
$5.2 million,  respectively,  were mandatory  commitments.  Loans  submitted for
approval or approved but not yet committed to purchase totaled $137.1 million as
of September 30, 2001,  compared to $109.1 million as of September 30, 2000. Not
all of these  loans are  purchased,  as some are denied  for  credit  reasons or
withdrawn by the seller.

     While significant progress has been made in developing the secondary market
for  agricultural  mortgages,  Farmer Mac  continues to face the  challenges  of
establishing  a market  where  none  previously  existed.  Use of  Farmer  Mac's
programs is increasing among lenders,  reflecting the competitive  rates,  terms
and products  offered and the  advantages  Farmer Mac's  programs  provide.  For
Farmer Mac to maximize its business  development and profitability over the long
term,  the use of Farmer Mac's  programs and products by  agricultural  mortgage
lenders, whether traditional or non-traditional, must continue to expand.

Balance Sheet Review

     During the nine  month  period  ended  September  30,  2001,  total  assets
increased by $216  million,  primarily  due to an increase in  on-balance  sheet
program  assets  (Farmer  Mac  guaranteed  securities  and  loans).  For further
information regarding both on- and off-balance sheet guaranteed securities,  see
"Supplemental  Information"  below. Total liabilities  increased by $219 million
from  December 31, 2000 to September  30, 2001  primarily  due to an increase in
notes payable.

     Average  return on equity,  excluding the effects of Statement of Financial
Accounting  Standards No. 115,  Accounting  for Certain  Investments in Debt and
Equity  Securities,  and SFAS 133,  reached 17.7 percent for third quarter 2001,
compared to 11.3 percent for third quarter 2000.

     As of September  30,  2001,  Farmer Mac's  statutory  core capital  totaled
$116.3  million,  compared to $101.2  million as of  December  31,  2000.  As of
September 30, 2001, the statutory  core capital  balance  exceeded  Farmer Mac's
statutory minimum capital requirement by approximately $8.2 million.

     On April 12, 2001, the Farm Credit Administration  ("FCA") issued its final
risk-based capital regulation for Farmer Mac. The regulation became effective on
May 23,  2001,  and Farmer Mac will be required to meet the  risk-based  capital
standards by May 23, 2002.  As noted in our June 12, 2000 comment  letter to the
FCA on the proposed  regulation,  Farmer Mac believes  that certain  significant
aspects of the risk-based  capital regulation do not comply with the authorizing
statute. We have maintained a dialogue with FCA regarding the application of the
regulation  and  the  complex  underlying  economic  model  -  particularly  the
provisions that suggest to us that the FCA went outside the authorizing statute.
If no change is made to the regulation before  compliance is required,  it could
lead to an increase  in the capital  requirement  for certain  newly  guaranteed
program assets and so alter Farmer Mac's strategic plan for future growth. While
we are at this time uncertain  whether the  regulation,  as issued,  would alter
that  strategic  plan,  we  continue  to expect  that any  issues  raised by the
regulation will be resolved in accordance  with the  authorizing  statute before
Farmer Mac is required to meet the risk-based capital standards.

Risk Management

     Interest-Rate Risk. Farmer Mac's asset and liability  management  objective
is to limit the effects of changes in interest  rates on its equity and earnings
to  within  acceptable  risk  tolerance  levels.  In doing so,  Farmer  Mac uses
callable debt and  derivative  financial  instruments,  including  interest-rate
swaps and caps (collectively "interest-rate contracts"),  forward sale contracts
involving  GSE  debt  and  mortgage-backed   securities  and  futures  contracts
involving U.S. Treasury securities.  Farmer Mac uses interest-rate  contracts to
alter the interest-rate  characteristics of specific  investments or debt, which
enable  Farmer  Mac  better to match the  interest-rate  characteristics  of its
investments  and debt.  As of September  30, 2001 and  December  31,  2000,  the
notional  amount  of  interest-rate  contracts  totaled  $1.0  billion  and $1.1
billion,  respectively.  Farmer Mac uses forward  sale and futures  contracts to
reduce its  interest-rate  risk exposure to loans committed or purchased and not
yet sold or funded as  retained  investments.  As of  September  30,  2001,  the
notional amount of outstanding forward sale and futures contracts totaled $111.8
million, compared to $8.6 million as of December 31, 2000.

     One method Farmer Mac uses to monitor its exposure to interest-rate risk is
to measure the sensitivity of its market value of equity ("MVE") to an immediate
and permanent  parallel shift of the U.S.  Treasury  yield curve.  The following
schedule  summarizes the results of Farmer Mac's MVE sensitivity  analysis as of
September 30, 2001 and December 31, 2000.

     Farmer Mac assumes 100 percent of the credit risk on  post-1996  Act Farmer
Mac I loans;  pre-1996 Act Farmer Mac I loans back securities that are supported
by mandatory 10 percent first loss  subordinated  interests that mitigate credit
exposure; Farmer Mac II loans are guaranteed by the USDA. Farmer Mac believes it
has little or no credit risk exposure to pre-1996 Act Farmer Mac I loans because
of the first loss subordinated  interests related to pools of those loans, or to
Farmer Mac II loans because of the USDA guarantee.

     As of  September  30, 2001,  post-1996  Act Farmer Mac I loans that were 90
days or more past due, in foreclosure or in bankruptcy  represented 2.16 percent
of the  outstanding  principal  balance of all post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I loans,
compared to 1.80  percent as of  September  30, 2000 and 1.72 percent as of June
30, 2001.  Farmer Mac  anticipates  fluctuations  in the  delinquency  rate from
quarter to quarter, with higher levels likely as of March 31 and September 30 of
each year due to the  semiannual  payment  characteristics  of most  Farmer  Mac
loans.

     The  following  table  shows  Farmer  Mac I  delinquencies  distributed  by
post-1996 Act loans and pre-1996 Act loans.

(2)  Farmer Mac assumes 100 percent of the credit risk on  post-1996  Act loans.
     Pre-1996 Act loans back securities that are supported by unguaranteed first
     loss subordinated  interests  representing  approximately 10 percent of the
     balance of the loans backing each security.

</TABLE>



     Farmer Mac  maintains a reserve to cover losses  incurred on post-1996  Act
Farmer Mac I loans.  Management  believes that existing post-1996 Act delinquent
loans have current  loan-to-value  ratios that adequately protect against losses
at liquidation, with the exception of certain loans that are secured in whole or
in part by depreciable assets or by real estate planted with commodities that do
not  benefit  from  direct  governmental  payments.  Farmer Mac expects to incur
losses  upon the  liquidation  of some of those  delinquent  loans,  such as the
$750,000 in losses  recognized  during third quarter 2001.  Management  believes
further potential losses are adequately covered by the reserve for losses, based
on the  value of the  collateral  securing  the  loans  and  Farmer  Mac's  loan
collection  experience.  In certain collateral  liquidation scenarios Farmer Mac
may recover  amounts  previously  written  off if  liquidation  proceeds  exceed
previous   estimates.   During  third   quarter   2001,   Farmer  Mac  recovered
approximately  $352,000 of  previously  written off assets.  As of September 30,
2001, the  weighted-average  original  loan-to-value ratio for all post-1996 Act
loans was 49.4 percent. Farmer Mac's provision for principal and interest losses
was $2.0  million for third  quarter  2001,  compared to $1.1  million for third
quarter 2000 and $1.4 million for second quarter 2001. As of September 30, 2001,
Farmer Mac's net reserve for losses  totaled $14.7  million,  or 0.44 percent of
outstanding  post-1996  Act loans  and AMBS,  compared  to $10.0  million  (0.43
percent) as of September 30, 2000.
