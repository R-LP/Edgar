Agricultural Mortgage Corporation ("Farmer Mac" or the "Corporation") have been
prepared, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission. These consolidated financial statements reflect all
normal and recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of management,
necessary to present a fair statement of the results for the interim periods

</TABLE>



            (d)  Reclassifications

      Certain reclassifications of prior period information were made to conform
to the current period presentation.

(e)   New Accounting Standards

     As amended, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting
for Derivative  Instruments and Hedging Activities ("SFAS 133") became effective
as of January 1, 2001.  SFAS 133 requires  financial  derivatives to be measured
and  recorded at fair value.  Such  derivatives,  which Farmer Mac uses to hedge
interest-rate risk, were previously accounted for as off-balance sheet items and
disclosed in the financial statement footnotes.

     The cumulative effect of this change in accounting principles, was a charge
of $726,000 and a negative  adjustment  of $8.6  million to other  comprehensive
income within stockholders' equity recognized on January 1, 2001. As part of the
implementation  of  SFAS  133,  Farmer  Mac  reclassified   certain   investment
securities  classified  as held to maturity  and  available  for sale as trading
securities.  The Corporation  expects that SFAS 133 will increase  volatility in
earnings and accumulated other comprehensive income.

     In September 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 140,  Accounting for Transfers
and Servicing of Financial  Assets and  Extinguishments  of  Liabilities  ("SFAS
140").  SFAS 140  will be  applied  prospectively  beginning  April  1,  2001 as
required by the standard.  Management does not expect the implementation of this
standard to materially affect the  Corporation's  reported results of operations
or financial position.

            (f)   Financial Derivatives

     Farmer Mac enters  into  derivative  instruments  as an  end-user,  not for
speculative purposes. Farmer Mac enters into interest-rate contracts,  including
interest-rate swaps and caps, to adjust the characteristics of Farmer Mac's debt
to more closely match the  characteristics of the Corporation's  mortgage assets
or to provide better returns on its investments. Derivative instruments, such as
forward  sale  contracts  of GSE debt and  mortgage-backed  securities  and U.S.
Treasury  based  futures  contracts,  are  entered  into by Farmer Mac to manage
interest-rate  risk  exposure  related to loan  purchases and  anticipated  debt
issuances.

     Interest-rate  swaps used to hedge corporate debt investments,  and forward
sale  contracts  used to hedge Farmer Mac's loan  portfolio,  are classified and
accounted  for as fair  value  hedges.  Interest-rate  swaps  and  forward  sale
contracts used to hedge  anticipated debt issuances are classified and accounted
for as cash flow  hedges.  Other  financial  derivatives,  such as  futures  and
interest-rate  caps, are not assigned an accounting  hedge  designation.  Farmer
Mac's  financial  derivatives  are carried at their fair values.  For fair value
hedges,  the  changes  in the fair  values of the  derivatives,  along  with the
changes in fair values of the hedged items,  are recorded in earnings.  For cash
flow hedges,  the changes in the fair values of the  derivatives are recorded in
other  comprehensive  income  and  any  hedge  ineffectiveness  is  recorded  in
earnings.   For  derivative   instruments  not  assigned  an  accounting   hedge
designation,  the changes in fair value are recorded in earnings.  Net after tax
charges  against  earnings  under SFAS 133 during  first  quarter  2001  totaled
$380,000,  and net after tax  reductions to other  comprehensive  income totaled
$3.6  million.  Farmer  Mac  estimates  that $1.2  million  of the total  amount
currently   reported  in  accumulated   other   comprehensive   income  will  be
reclassified  into earnings during the next twelve months.  Substantially all of
this amount  represents the estimated present value of the net interest payments
on  interest-rate  swap  contracts,  using fair  values as of March 31, 2001 and
assuming no change in interest  rates.  The  interest-rate  swap  contracts were
entered  into to  derive a lower  effective  fixed  rate cost of  borrowing  for
periods  of up to 15 years  than  would  otherwise  have been  available  to the
Corporation   in  the  market.   For  the  period  ended  March  31,  2001,  the
ineffectiveness  of  designated  hedges  recognized  as part of net  income  was
immaterial.

Note 2.  Off-Balance Sheet Guaranteed Securities

     For  information  regarding the  off-balance  sheet risks  associated  with
Farmer Mac's  guarantees of AMBS, see  "Management's  Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Management - Credit Risk."

Note 3.  Comprehensive Income

     Comprehensive  income  (loss) is comprised of net income plus other changes
in  stockholders'  equity not resulting from  investments by or distributions to
stockholders.  The following table sets forth comprehensive income for the three
months  ended  March 31,  2001 and 2000.  The  changes  in  unrealized  gains on
available-for-sale  securities  are net of the related  deferred  tax benefit of
$4.6  million  and $1.6  million for the three  months  ended March 31, 2001 and
2000,  respectively.  The change in the fair values of financial derivatives for
the three months ended March 31, 2001 is net of the related deferred tax benefit
of $6.7 million.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
        ----------------------------------------------------------------
        Results of Operations
        ---------------------

Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

     Certain statements made in this Form 10-Q are "forward-looking  statements"
within  the  meaning of the  Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform Act of 1995
pertaining  to  management's  current  expectations  as to Farmer  Mac's  future
financial results, business prospects and business developments. Forward-looking
statements  include,  without  limitation,   any  statement  that  may  predict,
forecast,  indicate or imply future results,  performance or  achievements,  and
typically are accompanied by, and identified with, such terms as  "anticipates,"
"believes,"  "expects,"  "intends," "should" and similar phrases.  The following
management's  discussion  and  analysis  includes   forward-looking   statements
addressing  Farmer Mac's  prospects  for  earnings and growth in loan  purchase,
guarantee   and   securitization   volume;   trends  in  net  interest   income,
delinquencies and provision for losses;  changes in capital position;  and other
business  and  financial  matters.  Management's  expectations  for Farmer Mac's
future  necessarily  involve  a number  of  assumptions  and  estimates  and the
evaluation  of risks and  uncertainties.  Various  factors or events could cause
Farmer  Mac's  actual  results to differ  materially  from the  expectations  as
expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements, including: uncertainties
regarding the rate and  direction of  development  of the  secondary  market for
agricultural mortgage loans; the possible  establishment of additional statutory
or regulatory  restrictions  applicable to Farmer Mac, such as the imposition of
regulatory risk-based capital requirements with an aggregate effect in excess of
the statutory  minimum and critical  capital  levels or  restrictions  on Farmer
Mac's  investment   authority;   substantial  changes  in  interest  rates,  the
agricultural  economy  (including  agricultural  land values,  commodity prices,
export demand for U.S.  agricultural products and federal assistance to farmers)
or the general economy;  protracted adverse weather,  market or other conditions
affecting  particular  geographic regions or particular  commodities  related to
agricultural   mortgage  loans  backing   Farmer  Mac   guaranteed   securities;
legislative  or  regulatory  developments  or  interpretations  of Farmer  Mac's
statutory  charter  that could  adversely  affect  Farmer Mac or the  ability of
certain  lenders  to  participate  in its  programs  or the  terms  of any  such
participation;  the availability of debt funding in sufficient quantities and at
favorable rates to support continued growth;  the rate of growth in agricultural
mortgage  indebtedness;  the size of the agricultural mortgage market;  borrower
preferences for fixed-rate  agricultural mortgage indebtedness;  the willingness
of lenders to sell  agricultural  mortgage  loans into the Farmer Mac  secondary
market;  the willingness of investors to invest in agricultural  mortgage-backed
securities;  competition in the origination or purchase of agricultural mortgage
loans  and the sale of  agricultural  mortgage-backed  and debt  securities;  or
changes in Farmer Mac's status as a government-sponsored enterprise.

     The foregoing factors are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report may
include additional factors that could adversely impact Farmer Mac's business and
its financial  performance.  Furthermore,  new risk factors  emerge from time to
time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor
assess the  impact of such  factors on Farmer  Mac's  business  or the extent to
which any factor, or combination of factors,  may cause actual results to differ
materially  from the  expectations  expressed or implied by the  forward-looking

Results of Operations

     Operating  Results.  SFAS 133  requires  the  change in the fair  values of
certain  financial  derivatives to be reflected in the  Corporation's net income
and other  comprehensive  income.  Management believes that reporting results by
reference to operating income  excluding the cumulative  effect of the change in
accounting  principles  recognized  on January  1, 2001 under SFAS 133,  and its
ongoing  effects during the reporting  period,  provides a meaningful  operating
measure of Farmer Mac's financial performance and position.  Such information is
presented to supplement,  not replace,  net income,  cash from operations or any
other  operating  or  liquidity  performance  measure  prescribed  by  generally
accepted accounting principles.

     Overview.  Net income for first quarter 2001,  including the cumulative and
ongoing  effects of SFAS 133 during the  quarter,  was $2.2 million or $0.18 per
share.  Net income for first  quarter  2000 was $2.4 million or $0.21 per share.
Operating income totaled $3.2 million for first quarter 2001, or $0.27 per share
on a diluted  basis,  compared to $2.4  million,  or $0.21 per share,  for first
quarter 2000. This represents a 29% increase in operating earnings per share.

     Farmer Mac's revenue growth continued in the first quarter 2001, reflecting
the effects of outstanding  guarantee volume 35 percent higher than in the first
quarter 2000 and the net interest  income earned on a higher average  balance of
outstanding interest-earning assets, which was 19 percent higher than during the
first  quarter  2000.  Purchases  and  guarantees  under the Farmer Mac I and II
programs  were 81% higher in the first  quarter  2001 than in the first  quarter
2000.  During first quarter 2001, Farmer Mac purchased $47.7 million of portions
of loans guaranteed by the United Sates Department of Agriculture,  establishing
a record  quarter  for the Farmer Mac II  program,  purchased  $48.6  million of
Farmer Mac I loans and recorded $49.7 million in long-term standby  commitments.
In  addition,  Farmer  Mac  entered  into  agreements  to  provide  Farmer Mac I
long-term standby commitments for an additional $150 million that go into effect
in the second quarter of 2001.

     Guarantee  volume  growth was achieved  during  first  quarter 2001 despite
continued  unfavorable  economic  conditions in the  agricultural  sector.  Weak
market opportunities for agricultural commodities and products and low commodity
prices have persisted  throughout 2000 and into 2001. Total direct  governmental
payments  to the  agricultural  sector  for  2000  are  estimated  by  the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA) to have been a record $22.1 billion,  resulting
in farm income levels  during 2000  significantly  above the decade  (1991-2000)
average. The federal income support is not allocated equally to producers of all
agricultural   commodities,   however,   and  farmers  and  ranchers   producing
agricultural  commodities that receive significant federal income support should
demonstrate  greater  liquidity  than those who do not receive  payments.  It is
expected that additional  federal  support will be provided to the  agricultural
sector in 2001;  although the specific amount has not yet been  determined,  the
federal budget  agreement  includes an additional $5.5 billion for this purpose,
subject to action by Congress to make such funds available. Farmer Mac responded
to these conditions by re-emphasizing  to agricultural  lenders their ability to
use Farmer Mac's programs to reduce their concentrated exposures to agricultural
credit risks.  Although the Corporation  believes that the increased interest in
portfolio  sales,  swaps and  long-term  standby  commitments  during  the first
quarter of 2001 is a good indication  that Farmer Mac has positioned  itself for
growth in the coming months and anticipates  additional  portfolio  transactions
during  the  remainder  of 2001,  the  total  volume  of those  transactions  is
uncertain at this time.

     Set forth below is a more  detailed  discussion  of Farmer Mac's results of
operations.

     Net Interest Income. Net interest income was $5.5 million for first quarter
2001,  compared to $4.6  million for first  quarter  2000.  The  increase in net
interest  income was  primarily  attributable  to  increases  in the  balance of
program assets, driven by Farmer Mac's retention of its guaranteed  agricultural
mortgage-backed  securities  ("AMBS").  The following table provides information
regarding the average balances and rates of interest-earning  assets and funding
for the three months ended March 31, 2001 and 2000.

     Other Income.  Other income, which is comprised of guarantee fee income and
miscellaneous  income,  totaled $3.6 million for first  quarter 2001 compared to
$2.8  million for the first  quarter  2000.  Guarantee  fee income,  the largest
component of other income, was $3.4 million for first quarter 2001,  compared to
$2.6 million for first quarter  2000.  The relative  increase in guarantee  fees
reflects  an  increase  in  the  average  balance  of  outstanding   guarantees.
Miscellaneous  income was $166,000 for first  quarter 2001 compared to a gain of
$182,000 for first quarter 2000.

     Expenses.  During  first  quarter  2001,  operating  expenses  totaled $2.6
million compared to $2.4 million for first quarter 2000. Operating expenses as a
percentage of operating revenues for first quarter 2001 and 2000 were 29 percent
and 33 percent, respectively.

     Farmer Mac's  provision for principal and interest  losses was $1.4 million
for first  quarter 2001  compared to $1.3 million for first  quarter 2000. As of
March 31, 2001,  Farmer Mac's reserve for losses totaled $12.4 million,  or 0.49
percent of outstanding  post-1996 Act loans,  compared to $7.9 million,  or 0.42
percent, as of March 31, 2000.

     Income Tax Expense. The provision for income taxes totaled $1.6 million for
first quarter 2001 compared to $1.3 million for first quarter 2000. Farmer Mac's
effective tax rate for each quarter was 35.5 percent.

</TABLE>


      See "Overview" above for a discussion regarding changes in the amount of
loans purchased and guaranteed by Farmer Mac.

     Indicators  of future  purchase and  guarantee  volume,  particularly  cash
purchase  activity,  include  outstanding  commitments to purchase loans and the
total balance of loans submitted for approval or approved but not yet purchased.
Most  purchase  commitments  entered into by Farmer Mac are  mandatory  delivery
commitments. If a seller obtains a mandatory commitment and is unable to deliver
the loans  required  thereunder  within the  specified  time period,  Farmer Mac
requires the seller to pay a fee to extend or cancel the commitment. As of March
31, 2001,  outstanding  commitments to purchase or guarantee  Farmer Mac I loans
totaled  $18.4  million,  compared to $10.7 million as of March 31, 2000. Of the
total commitments outstanding at March 31, 2001 and 2000, $10.5 million and $2.9
million,  respectively,  were optional commitments. Loans submitted for approval
or approved but not yet committed to purchase totaled $133.7 million as of March
31,  2001,  compared to $108.1  million as of March 31,  2000.  Not all of these
loans are  purchased,  as some are denied for credit reasons or withdrawn by the
seller.

     While significant progress has been made in developing the secondary market
for  agricultural  mortgages,  Farmer Mac  continues to face the  challenges  of
establishing a new market where none  previously  existed.  Acceptance of Farmer
Mac's programs is increasing  among lenders,  reflecting the competitive  rates,
terms and products offered and the advantages Farmer Mac's programs provide. For
Farmer Mac to succeed in realizing its business  development  and  profitability
goals over the long term,  the use of Farmer  Mac's  programs  and  products  by
agricultural  mortgage lenders,  whether  traditional or  non-traditional,  must
continue to expand.

Balance Sheet Review

     During first quarter 2001,  total assets  decreased by $244.8 million.  The
decrease in assets was due to a decrease in on-balance sheet non-program  assets
(cash  and  cash  equivalents  and  investments).  Program  assets,  Farmer  Mac
guaranteed securities and loans, were at a consistent level as of March 31, 2001
and  December  31,  2000.  For  further  information   regarding  both  on-  and
off-balance sheet guaranteed securities, see "Supplemental Information" below.

     Total  liabilities  decreased by $228.0  million from  December 31, 2000 to
March 31, 2001 due to a reduction in notes payable,  which  corresponded  to the
net decrease in total assets.

     Farmer Mac's regulatory core capital totaled $104.8 million as of March 31,
2001,  compared with $101.2 million as of December 31, 2000 and $91.6 million as
of March 31,  2000.  The capital  balance as of March 31, 2001  exceeded  Farmer
Mac's regulatory minimum capital requirements by approximately $14.1 million.

     On April 12, 2001, the Farm Credit Administration  ("FCA") issued its final
risk-based  capital  regulation  for Farmer Mac. The  regulation is scheduled to
become effective in less than one month, and Farmer Mac will be required to meet
the risk-based  capital standards one year after the effective date. As noted in
our June 12, 2000 comment letter to the FCA on the proposed  regulation,  Farmer
Mac  believes  that  certain  significant  aspects  of  the  risk-based  capital
regulation  do not comply  with the  authorizing  statute.  The  economic  model
incorporated in the regulation is extremely complex,  and we are still analyzing
its  potential  effects.  Farmer  Mac  has  requested  that  FCA  assist  us  in
understanding  the  operation  of the  regulation  and the  model;  however,  if
unchanged,  the regulation - particularly  those  provisions  that suggest to us
that the FCA went outside the authorizing statute - could lead to an increase in
the capital  requirement for certain newly guaranteed  off-balance sheet program
assets and so alter Farmer Mac's  strategic  plan for future  growth.  While the
Corporation is at this time uncertain whether the regulation,  as issued,  would
alter that  strategic  plan, we expect that any issues raised by the  regulation
will be resolved in accordance with the authorizing statute before Farmer Mac is
required to meet the risk-based capital standards.

     Average  return on equity,  excluding the effects of Statement of Financial
Accounting  Standards No. 115,  Accounting  for Certain  Investments in Debt and
Equity  Securities,  and SFAS 133,  was 12.3  percent  for first  quarter  2001,
compared to 10.5  percent  for first  quarter  2000 and 11.5  percent for fourth
quarter 2000.


Risk Management

     Interest-Rate Risk. Farmer Mac's asset and liability  management  objective
is to limit the effect of changes in interest  rates on its equity and  earnings
to  within  acceptable  risk  tolerance  levels.  In doing so,  Farmer  Mac uses
callable debt and  derivative  financial  instruments,  including  interest-rate
swaps and caps (collectively "interest-rate contracts"),  forward sale contracts
involving  GSE  debt  and  mortgage-backed   securities  and  futures  contracts
involving U.S. Treasury securities.  Farmer Mac uses interest-rate  contracts to
alter the interest rate  characteristics of specific  investments or debt, which
enables  Farmer  Mac  to  achieve  a  better   matching  of  the   interest-rate
characteristics  of its  investments and debt. As of March 31, 2001 and December
31, 2001 the notional amount of  interest-rate  contracts  totaled $1.03 billion
and $1.11  billion,  respectively.  Farmer  Mac uses  forward  sale and  futures
contracts  to reduce its  interest-rate  risk  exposure  to loans  committed  or
purchased  and not yet sold or funded as retained  investments.  As of March 31,
2001,  the notional  amount of  outstanding  forward sale and futures  contracts
totaled $54.6 million, compared to $8.6 million as of December 31, 2000.

     Farmer Mac  monitors its exposure to  interest-rate  risk by measuring  the
sensitivity  of its market value of equity (MVE) to an immediate  and  permanent
parallel shift in the Treasury yield curve.  The following  schedule  summarizes
the results of Farmer  Mac's MVE  sensitivity  analysis as of March 31, 2001 and
December 31, 2000. The increase in MVE sensitivity in the falling  interest rate
scenarios  reflects the lower level of interest rates at March 31, 2001 compared
to December 31, 2000 and the lengthening of the  Corporation's  debt maturities.

</TABLE>


     Farmer Mac assumes 100 percent of the credit risk on  post-1996  Act Farmer
Mac I loans;  pre-1996  Act Farmer Mac I loans are  supported  by  mandatory  10
percent first loss  subordinated  interests that mitigate credit  exposure;  and
Farmer  Mac II loans are  guaranteed  by the USDA.  Farmer Mac  believes  it has
little or no credit risk  exposure to pre-1996 Act Farmer Mac I loans because of
the first loss subordinated interests related to the pools of those loans, or to
Farmer Mac II loans because of the USDA guarantee.

     As of March 31, 2001, post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I loans that were 90 days or
more past due represented  2.62 percent of the principal amount of all post-1996
Act Farmer Mac I loans,  compared to 1.45  percent as of March 31, 2000 and 1.25
percent at  December  31,  2000.  Farmer  Mac  anticipates  fluctuations  in the
delinquency  rate from  quarter  to  quarter  with  higher  levels  likely to be
reported  during the first and third quarters of each year due to the semiannual
payment  characteristics  of most  Farmer  Mac loans.  While the  year-over-year
increase is not insignificant,  it is more reflective of liquidity issues in the
agricultural  sector than a decline in land values or other potentially  serious
drivers of loan losses.

     Total direct governmental  payments to the agricultural sector for 2000 are
estimated by the U.S.  Department  of  Agriculture  (USDA) to have been a record
$22.1 billion,  resulting in farm income levels during 2000 significantly  above
the decade  (1991-2000)  average.  The federal  income  support is not allocated
equally to producers of all agricultural  commodities,  however, and farmers and
ranchers producing  agricultural  commodities that receive  significant  federal
income  support  should  demonstrate  greater  liquidity  than  those who do not
receive  payments.  It is  expected  that  additional  federal  support  will be
provided to the  agricultural  sector in 2001;  although the specific amount has
not yet been  determined,  the federal budget  agreement  includes an additional
$5.5 billion for this purpose,  subject to action by Congress to make such funds
available.

     The  following  table  shows  Farmer  Mac I  delinquencies  distributed  by
post-1996 Act loans and pre-1996 Act loans.

       Although credit losses are expected to be incurred on the existing
post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I delinquencies, Farmer Mac believes that those losses
are adequately covered by the reserve for loan losses, based on the value of the
collateral supporting the loans. The following table summarizes the post-1996
Act delinquencies by loan-to-value ratio (calculated by dividing the current
loan principal balance by the original appraised value):
