Item 1. Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

     The following interim condensed  consolidated  financial  statements of the

have been prepared,  without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the
Securities  and  Exchange  Commission.   These  interim  condensed  consolidated
financial  statements reflect all normal and recurring  adjustments that are, in
the  opinion  of  management,  necessary  to  present  a fair  statement  of the
financial  condition and the results of operations  and cash flows of Farmer Mac
for the interim periods presented.  Certain information and footnote disclosures
normally  included  in  annual  consolidated   financial  statements  have  been
condensed  or omitted as  permitted  by such rules and  regulations.  Management
believes  that the  disclosures  are  adequate to present  fairly the  condensed
consolidated  financial position,  condensed  consolidated results of operations
and  condensed  consolidated  cash  flows as of the  dates  and for the  periods
presented.  These condensed  consolidated financial statements should be read in
conjunction with the audited 2002  consolidated  financial  statements of Farmer
Mac included in the Corporation's  Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended

Note 1.  Accounting Policies

(a)   Cash and Cash Equivalents

     Farmer Mac considers  highly liquid  investment  securities  with remaining
maturities  of  three  months  or  less  at the  time  of  purchase  to be  cash
equivalents. Changes in the balance of cash and cash equivalents are reported in
the Condensed  Consolidated  Statements of Cash Flows.  The following table sets
forth information  regarding certain cash and non-cash transactions for the nine
months ended September 30, 2003 and 2002.

(b)   Loans

     As of September 30, 2003,  loans held by Farmer Mac included  $30.5 million
held for sale and $949.1 million held for  investment.  As of December 31, 2002,
loans held by Farmer Mac included $37.0 million held for sale and $929.1 million
held for  investment.  Detailed  information  regarding  the  allowance for loan
losses is presented in Note 1(c).

            (c) Allowance for Losses

     As of September 30, 2003,  Farmer Mac maintained a $22.7 million  allowance
and contingent  obligation for probable losses ("allowance for losses") to cover
estimated probable losses on loans held, real estate owned, and loans underlying
Long-Term Standby Purchase Commitments  ("LTSPCs") and securities  guaranteed by
Farmer Mac under the Farmer Mac I program after the 1996 revision to its charter
("Post-1996  Act  Farmer  Mac  I  Guaranteed  Securities").  (See  Note  3 for a
description of LTSPCs.) The allowance for losses is increased  through  periodic
provisions  for loan  losses that are charged  against net  interest  income and
provisions  for losses that are charged to  operating  expense and is reduced by
charge-offs  for actual losses,  net of  recoveries.  The  establishment  of and
periodic  adjustments to the REO valuation  allowance are charged against income
as a portion of the provision for losses charged to operating expense.

     Farmer Mac estimates probable losses using a systematic process that begins
with  management's  evaluation  of the  results  of its  proprietary  loan  pool
simulation  and  guarantee  fee  model  (the  "Model").  The  Model  draws  upon
historical  information from a data set of agricultural  mortgage loans recorded
over a longer period of time than Farmer Mac's own experience to date,  screened
to include  only those  loans with  credit  characteristics  similar to those on
which Farmer Mac has assumed credit risk. The results generated by the Model are
subject to modification  by the application of management's  judgment that takes
into account factors including:

     o    economic conditions;
     o    geographic and agricultural  commodity  concentrations in Farmer Mac's
          portfolio;
     o    the credit profile of Farmer Mac's portfolio;
     o    delinquency trends of Farmer Mac's portfolio;
     o    Farmer  Mac's  experience  in the  management  and sale of real estate
          owned; and
     o    historical   charge-off  and  recovery   activities  of  Farmer  Mac's
          portfolio.

     Management  believes that its use of this  methodology  produces a reliable
estimate of total probable  losses,  as of the balance sheet date, for all loans
included in Farmer Mac's portfolio,  including loans held, real estate owned and
loans underlying Post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs.

     Farmer Mac expects its methodology for determining its allowance for losses
will  migrate  over time  away  from the Model and be based on Farmer  Mac's own
historical portfolio loss experience.  Until that time, Farmer Mac will continue
to use the results from the Model,  augmented by the application of management's
judgment (as described above), to determine its allowance for losses.

     The table below  summarizes  the  components of Farmer Mac's  allowance for
losses,  which includes its contingent  obligation  for probable  losses,  as of
September 30, 2003 and December 31, 2002.

</TABLE>

     No  allowance  for losses has been made for loans  underlying  Farmer Mac I
Guaranteed  Securities issued prior to the Farm Credit System Reform Act of 1996
(the "1996 Act") or securities  issued under the Farmer Mac II program  ("Farmer
Mac II Guaranteed Securities").  Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities issued prior
to the 1996 Act are supported by unguaranteed first loss subordinated interests,
which are expected to exceed the  estimated  credit  losses on those loans.  The
guaranteed portions of loans collateralizing Farmer Mac II Guaranteed Securities
are  guaranteed by the United States  Department of Agriculture  ("USDA").  Each
USDA  guarantee  is an  obligation  backed by the full  faith and  credit of the
United  States.  To date,  Farmer Mac has  experienced  no credit  losses on any
pre-1996  Act  Farmer  Mac I  Guaranteed  Securities  or on  any  Farmer  Mac II
Guaranteed  Securities  and does not  expect  to incur  any such  losses  in the
future.

            (d) Financial Derivatives

     Farmer Mac enters into  financial  derivative  transactions  principally to
protect against risk from the effects of market price or interest rate movements
on the value of certain assets and future cash flows or debt  issuance,  not for
trading or  speculative  purposes.  Farmer Mac enters  into  interest  rate swap
contracts  principally to adjust the  characteristics  of its short-term debt to
match more closely the cash flow and duration characteristics of its longer-term
mortgage  and  other  assets,  and also to  adjust  the  characteristics  of its
long-term debt to match more closely the cash flow and duration  characteristics
of  its  short-term   assets,   thereby  reducing   interest  rate  risk.  These
transactions  also may provide an overall lower effective cost of borrowing than
would otherwise be available in the conventional debt market.

     All financial  derivatives  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value
as  a  freestanding  asset  or  liability.   Financial  derivatives  in  hedging
relationships  that mitigate exposure to changes in the fair value of assets are
considered  fair value hedges.  Financial  derivatives in hedging  relationships
that mitigate the exposure to the  variability in expected  future cash flows or
other  forecasted  transactions  are  considered  cash  flow  hedges.  Financial
derivatives  that do not satisfy the hedging  criteria of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative  Instruments and Hedging
Activities,  as amended ("SFAS 133") are not accounted for as hedges and changes
in the fair  values of those  financial  derivatives  are  reported in income or
expense.

     The net after-tax  decrease to earnings under SFAS 133 during third quarter
2003 totaled $2.2 million, and the net after-tax increase to other comprehensive
income  totaled  $11.5  million.  Substantially  all of the decrease in earnings
under SFAS 133 resulted from  decreases in the fair values of callable  interest
rate contracts.  Substantially all of the increase to other comprehensive income
represented changes in the fair values of forward sale contracts,  interest rate
swap  contracts and settled  forward sale  contracts.  As of September 30, 2003,
Farmer Mac had approximately $56.5 million of net after-tax unrealized losses on
cash flow hedges  included in  accumulated  other  comprehensive  income.  These
amounts will be reclassified  into earnings in the same period or periods during
which the hedged forecasted  transactions (either the payment of interest or the
issuance of discount  notes)  affect  earnings  or  immediately  when it becomes
probable that the original hedged  forecasted  transaction will not occur within
two months of the originally specified date. Over the next twelve months, Farmer
Mac estimates that $1.3 million of the amount currently  reported in accumulated
other  comprehensive  income (loss) will be reclassified into earnings.  For the
quarter ended  September 30, 2003, any  ineffectiveness  related to Farmer Mac's
designated hedges was insignificant.

(e)   Earnings Per Common Share

     Basic earnings per common share are based on the weighted-average number of
common shares  outstanding.  Diluted  earnings per common share are based on the
weighted-average  number of common  shares  outstanding  adjusted to include all
potentially  dilutive common stock options.  The following  schedule  reconciles
basic and diluted  earnings per common share for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2003 and 2002:

(f)   Preferred Stock

     On May 6, 2002, the Corporation  issued 700,000 shares of 6.40%  Cumulative
Preferred Stock,  Series A ("Series A Preferred Stock"),  which has a redemption
price and  liquidation  preference of $50.00 per share,  plus accrued and unpaid
dividends,  if any. The Series A Preferred  Stock does not have a maturity date.
Beginning  on June 30,  2012,  Farmer  Mac has the option to redeem the Series A
Preferred  Stock at any time,  in whole or in part, at the  redemption  price of
$50.00 per share,  plus accrued and unpaid  dividends  through and including the
redemption date, if any. Farmer Mac will pay cumulative  dividends on the Series
A Preferred  Stock  quarterly  in arrears,  when and if declared by its Board of
Directors.  The costs of issuing  the Series A Preferred  Stock were  charged to
additional paid-in capital.

     On August 7, 2003,  Farmer Mac's Board of Directors  declared a dividend of
$0.80 per share on the Series A Preferred Stock for the period from July 1, 2003
to September  30, 2003.  The  dividend,  in the amount of $560,000,  was paid on
September 30, 2003.

            (g) Stock-Based Compensation

     Farmer Mac accounts for its stock-based  employee  compensation plans using
the intrinsic value method of accounting for employee stock options  pursuant to
Accounting  Principles  Board  Opinion No. 25,  Accounting  for Stock  Issued to
Employees,  and has adopted  the  disclosure-only  provisions  of  Statement  of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based  Compensation
("SFAS 123"), as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation--Transition and Disclosure ("SFAS 148").
Accordingly,  no  compensation  expense was  recognized in third quarter 2003 or
third quarter 2002 for employee stock options. Had Farmer Mac elected to use the
fair value method of accounting for employee stock options, net income available
to common  stockholders  and  earnings  per share for the three and nine  months
ended  September  30,  2003 and 2002  would  have been  reduced to the pro forma
amounts indicated in the following table:

            (h) Reclassifications

      Certain reclassifications of prior period information were made to conform
to the current period presentation.

            (i) New Accounting Standards

     On January 1, 2003,  Farmer Mac adopted  Statement of Financial  Accounting
Standards No. 145,  Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of
FASB  Statement No. 13 and Technical  Corrections  ("SFAS 145"),  which requires
gains and losses from the  extinguishment or repurchase of debt to be classified
as extraordinary items only if they meet the criteria for such classification in
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30, Reporting the Results of Operations,
Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business and  Extraordinary,
Unusual and Infrequently  Occurring Events and Transactions ("APB 30"). Prior to
the  adoption  of this  standard,  gains and losses from the  extinguishment  or
repurchase  of debt  were  classified  as  extraordinary  items.  This  standard
effectively  eliminates  the  classification  of most  debt  extinguishments  or
repurchases  as  extraordinary  items,  as reflected  in Farmer Mac's  condensed
consolidated  financial statements as of and for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2003. Farmer Mac's condensed  consolidated financial statements as
of and for the three and nine months ended  September  30, 2002  reflected  debt
extinguishments or repurchases as extraordinary items.

     On January 1, 2003, Farmer Mac adopted the liability recognition provisions
of FIN 45. These provisions require Farmer Mac to recognize, at the inception of
a guarantee,  a liability for the fair value of its obligation to stand ready to
perform under the terms of each  guarantee  agreement and an asset that is equal
to the fair  value  of the  fees  that  will be  received  over the life of each
guarantee.  Subsequently,  both the asset and the  liability  are  measured  and
recorded  at  their  fair  value.  These  provisions  have  been  applied  on  a
prospective  basis to guarantees and commitments that were issued or modified on
or after January 1, 2003. See Note 3 for additional  information on Farmer Mac's
guarantee  obligations  and LTSPCs and the  manner in which the  obligations  to
"stand  ready"  have been  reflected  in  Farmer  Mac's  condensed  consolidated
financial  statements.  See Note 1(c) for information on the portion of the fair
value of this  obligation  that  represents  inherent  probable  losses that are
included as part of Farmer Mac's allowance for losses.

     In April 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative
Instruments and Hedging  Activities  ("SFAS 149"). SFAS 149 amends and clarifies
financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including certain
derivatives  embedded in other contracts,  and for hedging activities under SFAS
133. SFAS 149 was effective  for contracts  entered into or modified  after June
30, 2003, with some exceptions.  The  implementation  of SFAS 149 did not have a
material impact on the accounting or reporting of Farmer Mac's derivatives.

     During third quarter 2003, the Chief Accountant at the U.S.  Securities and
Exchange Commission  provided  additional guidance to all registrants  regarding
the  classification  on the statement of operations of realized gains and losses
resulting  from  financial  derivatives  that are not in fair value or cash flow
hedge relationships. All registrants were requested to comply with this guidance
in  future  filings  and to  reclassify  this  activity  for all  prior  periods
presented.  As a result of the application of this additional guidance,  the net
interest income and expense  realized on financial  derivatives  that are not in
fair  value or cash flow hedge  relationships  have been  reclassified  from net
interest  income  into gains and losses on  financial  derivatives  and  trading
assets.   For  the  nine  months  ended   September  30,  2003  and  2002,  this
reclassification  resulted in increases of net  interest  income and  offsetting
decreases in gains and losses on  financial  derivatives  and trading  assets of
$0.5 million and $3.3 million, respectively.


Note 2.  Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities

     Farmer Mac creates Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities through the transfer of
agricultural  mortgage  loans  into  trusts  that are used as  vehicles  for the
securitization  of the  transferred  assets.  The beneficial  interests that are
securitized  are either  retained or sold to third party  investors.  Farmer Mac
records the  beneficial  interests  that it has retained on its balance sheet as
Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities.  As of  September  30, 2003 and December 31,
2002, retained Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities included the following:

     These  sensitivities  are hypothetical and should be viewed as such. As the
figures  indicate,  changes in fair value  based on a 10  percent  variation  in
assumptions  generally  cannot be extrapolated  because the  relationship of the
change in  assumptions  to the change in fair value may not be linear.  Also, in
this table the effect of a  variation  in a  particular  assumption  on the fair
value  of the  retained  interest  is  calculated  without  changing  any  other
assumption. In fact, changes in one factor may result in changes in another (for
example,  increases in market  interest rates may result in lower  prepayments),
which might amplify or counteract the sensitivities.

     Farmer Mac securitizes two types of assets: agricultural mortgage loans and
USDA-guaranteed  portions. Farmer Mac manages the credit risk of its securitized
agricultural  mortgage loans, both on- and off-balance sheet,  together with its
on-balance sheet agricultural mortgage loans and the agricultural mortgage loans
underlying its off-balance sheet LTSPCs.  Due to the differing interest rate and
funding risk characteristics of on- and off-balance sheet asset classes,  Farmer
Mac  manages  its  on-balance  sheet   agricultural   mortgage  loans  held  and
securitized  differently  from its off-balance  sheet  securitized  agricultural
mortgage loans and  off-balance  sheet  agricultural  mortgage loans  underlying
LTSPCs.

     Farmer Mac separately manages its securitized  USDA-guaranteed portions and
manages  those  held on its  balance  sheet  differently  from  those  that  are
off-balance  sheet - also due to their differing  interest rate and funding risk
characteristics.

     As part of fulfilling its guarantee obligations for Farmer Mac I Guaranteed
Securities and commitments to purchase eligible loans underlying LTSPCs,  Farmer
Mac purchases  defaulted  loans, all of which are at least 90 days delinquent at
the time of  purchase,  out of those  securities  and  pools,  and  records  the
purchased loans as such on its balance sheet.

     The  table  below  presents  the  outstanding  principal  balances,  90-day
delinquencies and net credit losses as of and for the periods indicated for each
managed asset class, both on- and off-balance sheet.

Note 3.  Off-Balance Sheet Guarantees and Long-Term Standby Purchase Commitments


Overview

     Farmer Mac offers  approved  agricultural  and rural  residential  mortgage
lenders two  off-balance  sheet  alternatives  to increase  their  liquidity  or
lending  capacity  while  retaining the cash flow  benefits of their loans:  (1)
Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities,  which are available through either the Farmer
Mac I program or the Farmer Mac II program,  and (2) LTSPCs, which are available
only through the Farmer Mac I program.

     For a loan to be  eligible  for the Farmer Mac I program,  whether the loan
underlies  a Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Security  or an LTSPC,  it must meet Farmer
Mac's credit underwriting, appraisal and documentation standards.

     For all guarantees and commitments that were executed on or before December
31, 2002,  Farmer Mac's policy for the  recognition  of guarantee fees on Farmer
Mac Guaranteed  Securities and commitment fees on LTSPCs is to recognize them on
an accrual basis over the life of the underlying  loans.  Because these fees are
paid in arrears, no guarantee fees or commitment fees are unearned at the end of
any reporting  period.  If Farmer Mac purchases a delinquent  loan  underlying a
Farmer  Mac  Guaranteed  Security  or an LTSPC,  Farmer Mac stops  accruing  the
guarantee or  commitment  fee upon the purchase of the loan. If the loan becomes
current and is  repurchased  by the seller under the terms of the LTSPC,  Farmer
Mac resumes accrual of the fee.

     Pursuant to FIN 45, for all guarantees and  commitments  issued or modified
on or after January 1, 2003, Farmer Mac recognizes an asset that is equal to the
fair value of the fees that will be received over the life of each  guarantee or
commitment  and a liability for the fair value of its  obligation to stand ready
to perform under the guarantee or  commitment.  Both the asset and the liability
are  subsequently  measured  and  recorded  at their fair value in Farmer  Mac's
condensed consolidated financial statements.

     During third quarter 2003, at the request of Farm Credit West,  A.C.A.,  of
which one of Farmer Mac's directors is President,  Farmer Mac converted a $722.3
million LTSPC that had been  established  prior to January 1, 2003 into a Farmer
Mac I  Guaranteed  Security.  To achieve this  result,  the program  participant
transferred a pool of  agricultural  loans to Farmer Mac, Farmer Mac transferred
the loans to a trust,  and the trust issued  Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities
that were transferred by Farmer Mac to the program  participant.  Because Farmer
Mac received no proceeds other than the beneficial  interests in the transferred
assets, the transfer between Farmer Mac and the trust does not qualify as either
a sale or a financing; therefore, no gain or loss was recognized in Farmer Mac's
financial  statements.  Additionally,  the  trust  met  the  requirements  to be
classified  as a  qualifying  special  purpose  entity;  therefore,  it was  not
consolidated into Farmer Mac's financial statements.

Off-Balance Sheet Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities

     The process for creating off-balance sheet Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities
involves the transfer of  agricultural  mortgage loans into trusts that are used
as vehicles for the  securitization of the transferred assets and the beneficial
interests  in the  trusts  are sold to  third  party  investors  as  Farmer  Mac
Guaranteed Securities. Farmer Mac guarantees the timely payment of principal and
interest on the  certificates  issued by the trusts,  regardless  of whether the
trusts actually receive scheduled  payments on the related  underlying loans. As
consideration  for Farmer Mac's  assumption of the credit risk on these mortgage
pass-through  certificates,  Farmer Mac receives a guarantee fee. These fees are
collected as installment  payments are made on the underlying loans, until those
loans have been  repaid,  repurchased  from the  related  trusts,  or  otherwise
liquidated (generally as a result of default). The aggregate amount of guarantee
fees  received on Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities  depends upon the amount of
such securities outstanding and on the guarantee fee rate.


     Farmer Mac is required to make the timely payment of principal and interest
on Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities if the borrowers on the underlying loans or
USDA-guaranteed portions do not make their scheduled installment payments.

     o    Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities. Except as noted below, when a loan
          underlying a Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Security becomes 90 days or more
          past due, Farmer Mac, in its sole discretion,  may repurchase the loan
          from the trust and  generally  does  repurchase  such  loans,  thereby
          reducing  the  principal  balance  of  the  outstanding  Farmer  Mac I
          Guaranteed Security. In the case of Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities
          issued in exchange for loans underlying LTSPCs, the past due period is
          four  months  and  the  majority  of the  security  holders  have  the
          discretion to require Farmer Mac to repurchase  such loans.  If Farmer
          Mac  repurchases  a  loan  that  is  collateral  for  a  Farmer  Mac I
          Guaranteed  Security,  Farmer Mac would have the right to enforce  the
          terms of the loan and, in the event of a default, would have the right
          to  foreclose  upon the  collateral  underlying  the loan.  Farmer Mac
          typically  recovers a  significant  portion of the value of  defaulted
          loans  purchased  either  through  borrower  payments,  loan  payoffs,
          payments by third parties or foreclosure and sale of the collateral.

     o    Farmer Mac II  Guaranteed  Securities.  Farmer Mac has recourse to the
          USDA for amounts  advanced  for the timely  payment of  principal  and
          interest on Farmer Mac II Guaranteed Securities.  That recourse is the
          USDA  guarantee,  a full  faith and  credit  obligation  of the United
          States that becomes  enforceable  if a lender fails to repurchase  the
          USDA-guaranteed  portion from its owner  within 30 days after  written
          demand from the owner when (a) the borrower under the guaranteed  loan
          is in default not less than 60 days in the payment of any principal or
          interest  due on the  USDA-guaranteed  portion,  or (b) the lender has
          failed to remit to the owner the payment  made by the  borrower on the
          USDA-guaranteed  portion or any related  loan  subsidy  within 30 days
          after the lender's receipt of the payment.

     The  following  table  presents the maximum  principal  amount of potential
undiscounted  future  payments  that  Farmer Mac could be required to make under
off-balance sheet Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities as of September 30, 2003 and
December 31, 2002, not including  offsets  provided by any recourse  provisions,
recoveries from third parties or collateral for the underlying loans.

</TABLE>

     As of September 30, 2003, the  weighted-average  remaining  maturity of all
loans  underlying  off-balance  sheet Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities was 16.5
years.  For the off-balance  sheet Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities that were
executed on or before  December 31,  2002,  Farmer Mac has recorded an allowance
for  probable  losses that was $0.8  million as of  September  30, 2003 and $1.3
million as of  December  31,  2002.  For those  securities  that were  issued or
modified on or after January 1, 2003,  Farmer Mac has recorded the fair value of
its  obligation  to stand  ready  under  the  guarantee  as a  liability.  As of
September 30, 2003, this liability  approximated $7.5 million and is reported in
the guarantee and commitment  obligation on the condensed  consolidated  balance
sheet.

Long-Term Standby Purchase Commitments (LTSPCs)

     An LTSPC is a commitment by Farmer Mac to purchase  eligible loans,  either
for cash or in exchange for Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities,  on one or more
undetermined  future dates. In consideration  for Farmer Mac's assumption of the
credit  risk on loans  underlying  an  LTSPC,  Farmer  Mac  receives  an  annual
commitment  fee  based on the  outstanding  balance  of those  loans in  monthly
installments.

     An LTSPC permits a seller to nominate from its portfolio a segregated  pool
of loans,  which are  retained in the  seller's  portfolio  and  serviced by the
seller.  Upon  nomination,  Farmer Mac reviews the loan pool to confirm  that it
conforms to Farmer Mac's underwriting standards. Upon Farmer Mac's acceptance of
the conforming loans, the seller effectively  transfers the credit risk on those
loans to Farmer Mac,  thereby  reducing  the seller's  credit and  concentration
exposures and,  consequently,  its regulatory capital requirements and loan loss
reserve requirements. Credit risk is transferred through Farmer Mac's commitment
to purchase the segregated loans from the  counterparty  based upon Farmer Mac's
original credit review and acceptance of the credit risk on the loans.

     The  specific  events or  circumstances  that would  require  Farmer Mac to
purchase some or all of the segregated  loans under its LTSPCs include:  (1) the
failure of the borrower under any loan to make  installment  payments under that
loan for a period  of at least  four  months;  or (2) the  determination  by the
holder of the  LTSPC to sell some or all of the loans  under the LTSPC to Farmer
Mac.

      An LTSPC commits Farmer Mac to purchase these loans:

     o    at par, if the loans become four months  delinquent,  with accrued and
          unpaid interest payable out of any future loan payments or liquidation
          proceeds received;

     o    at a  mark-to-market  price,  if the loans are not  delinquent and are
          standard Farmer Mac loan products;

     o    at a  mark-to-market  negotiated price for all (but not some) loans in
          the pool, if they are not four months delinquent; or

     o    in exchange for Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities.

The  mark-to-market  price  would be based on either  the sale of  Farmer  Mac I
Guaranteed  Securities in the capital markets or the funding  obtained by Farmer
Mac through the issuance of debt in the capital markets.


     As of  September  30, 2003 and December  31,  2002,  the maximum  principal
amount of  potential  undiscounted  future  payments  that  Farmer  Mac could be
requested to make under LTSPCs,  not including  offsets provided by any recourse
provisions,  recoveries  from third  parties or  collateral  for the  underlying
loans, was $2.2 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively.

     Farmer Mac believes that the credit risk assumed in LTSPC  transactions  is
the same as the credit risk  assumed on  Post-1996  Act Farmer Mac I  Guaranteed
Securities.  In the event of loan  default,  Farmer  Mac would have the right to
enforce  the  terms of the  loans  including  the  right to  foreclose  upon the
collateral  underlying  such loans.  Farmer Mac believes that it will  generally
recover a  significant  portion of the value of the  defaulted  loans  purchased
either through  borrower  payments,  loan payoffs,  payments by third parties or
foreclosure  and sale of the  collateral.  For all LTSPC  transactions  to date,
Farmer Mac has incurred a charge-off on one loan.

     As of September 30, 2003, the  weighted-average  remaining  maturity of all
loans underlying  LTSPCs was 14.5 years. For the LTSPCs that were executed on or
before  December  31, 2002,  Farmer Mac has  recorded an allowance  for probable
losses that was $6.9  million as of September  30, 2003 and $11.4  million as of
December  31,  2002.  For those  LTSPCs that were issued or modified on or after
January 1, 2003,  Farmer Mac has  recorded the fair value of its  obligation  to
stand ready under the commitment as a liability.  As of September 30, 2003, this
liability  approximated  $8.2  million  and was  included in the  guarantee  and
commitment obligation on the condensed consolidated balance sheet.


Note 4.  Comprehensive Income

     Comprehensive  income is  comprised  of net income  plus  other  changes in
stockholders'  equity not resulting  from  investments  by or  distributions  to
stockholders.  The following table sets forth comprehensive income for the three
and nine months ended  September  30, 2003 and 2002.  The changes in  unrealized
gains on securities  available-for-sale are net of the related deferred taxes of
$7.4 million and $4.4 million for the three and nine months ended  September 30,
2003,  respectively,  and $13.2 million and $19.6 million for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2002, respectively.  The changes in the fair value of
the financial derivatives  classified as cash flow hedges for the three and nine
months ended  September  30, 2003 are net of deferred  taxes of $6.2 million and
$3.3  million,  respectively,  and $10.2 million and $16.3 million for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2002, respectively.

Item 2. Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
        of Operations


Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

     Certain  statements  made in this report are  "forward-looking  statements"
within  the  meaning of the  Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform Act of 1995
pertaining  to  management's  current  expectations  as to Farmer  Mac's  future
financial results, business prospects and business developments. Forward-looking
statements  include,  without  limitation,   any  statement  that  may  predict,
forecast,  indicate or imply future results,  performance or  achievements,  and
typically are accompanied by, and identified with, such terms as  "anticipates,"
"believes,"  "expects,"  "intends," "should" and similar phrases.  The following
management's  discussion  and  analysis  includes   forward-looking   statements
addressing  Farmer Mac's  prospects  for  earnings and growth in loan  purchase,
guarantee,  LTSPC and securitization  volume;  trends in net interest income and
provision  for  losses;  changes in capital  position;  and other  business  and
financial matters.

     Management's  expectations  for Farmer Mac's future  necessarily  involve a
number of assumptions,  estimates and the evaluation of risks and uncertainties.
Various  factors  could cause Farmer  Mac's  actual  results or events to differ
materially from the expectations as expressed or implied by the  forward-looking
statements, including uncertainties regarding:

     o    the rate and  direction of  development  of the  secondary  market for
          agricultural mortgage loans;
     o    the possible  establishment  of  additional  statutory  or  regulatory
          restrictions  on Farmer Mac that could  hamper its growth or  restrain
          its profitability;
     o    legislative or regulatory  developments or  interpretations  of Farmer
          Mac's statutory  charter that could adversely affect Farmer Mac or the
          ability of certain lenders to participate in its programs or the terms
          of any such participation;
     o    possible  reaction  in  the  financial  markets  to  events  involving
          government-sponsored enterprises other than Farmer Mac;
     o    Farmer Mac's access to the debt markets at favorable rates and terms;
     o    the  possible  effect of the  risk-based  capital  requirement,  which
          could,  under  certain  circumstances,  be in excess of the  statutory
          minimum capital level;
     o    the rate of growth in agricultural mortgage indebtedness;
     o    lender  interest  in Farmer  Mac  credit  products  and the Farmer Mac
          secondary market;
     o    borrower    preferences   for   fixed-rate    agricultural    mortgage
          indebtedness;
     o    competitive  pressures in the purchase of agricultural  mortgage loans
          and the sale of agricultural mortgage-backed and debt securities;
     o    substantial  changes in  interest  rates,  agricultural  land  values,
          commodity prices, export demand for U.S. agricultural products and the
          general economy;
     o    protracted  adverse  weather,  market  or other  conditions  affecting
          particular  geographic  regions or particular  commodities  related to
          agricultural mortgage loans backing Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities
          or under LTSPCs; or
     o    the  effects on the  agricultural  economy  of any  changes in federal
          assistance for agriculture.

     The foregoing factors are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report may
include additional factors that could adversely affect Farmer Mac's business and
its financial  performance.  Furthermore,  new risk factors  emerge from time to
time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor
assess the  effects of such  factors on Farmer  Mac's  business or the extent to
which any factor, or combination of factors,  may cause actual results to differ
materially  from the  expectations  expressed or implied by the  forward-looking
statements.  In light of  these  potential  risks  and  uncertainties,  no undue
reliance should be placed on any  forward-looking  statements  expressed in this
report. Furthermore, Farmer Mac undertakes no obligation to release publicly the
results  of  revisions  to any  forward-looking  statements  that may be made to
reflect any future events or circumstances  except as otherwise  mandated by the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

     The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with
accounting  principles  generally accepted in the United States requires the use
of  estimates  and  assumptions   that  affect  the  amounts   reported  in  the
consolidated  financial  statements and related notes for the periods presented.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. The critical accounting policy
that is both important to the portrayal of Farmer Mac's financial  condition and
results  of  operations  and  requires  complex,  subjective  judgments  is  the
accounting  policy for the  allowance  for losses.  Farmer Mac's  allowance  for
losses is presented as follows on its consolidated balance sheet:

     o    an "Allowance for loan losses" on loans held for investment;
     o    a valuation  allowance on real estate owned,  which is included in the
          balance sheet under "Real estate owned, net of valuation allowance";
     o    an allowance for losses on loans underlying Post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I
          Guaranteed  Securities  and  LTSPCs  entered  into or  modified  after
          January 1, 2003,  which is included in the balance  sheet as a portion
          of the amount reported as "Guarantee and commitment obligation"; and
     o    an allowance for losses on loans underlying Post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I
          Guaranteed  Securities  and  LTSPCs  entered  into prior to January 1,
          2003,  which is  included  in the balance  sheet  under  "Reserve  for
          losses."

     The purpose of the allowance for losses is to provide for estimated  losses
that are probable to have occurred as of the balance sheet date,  not to predict
or account for future potential  losses.  The determination of the allowance for
losses requires  management to make  significant  estimates based on information
available  as of the  balance  sheet date,  including  the amounts and timing of
losses and current market and economic  conditions.  These estimates are subject
to change in future reporting periods if such conditions and information change.
For example, a continued decline in the national or agricultural economies could
result in an  increase  in  delinquencies  or  foreclosures,  which may  require
additional allowances for losses in future periods.

      Farmer Mac maintains an allowance for losses to cover estimated probable
losses on its loans held, real estate owned and loans underlying Post-1996 Act
Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs. In estimating probable losses,
management considers the results of its proprietary loan pool simulation and
guarantee fee model. Those results may be modified by the application of
management's judgment that takes into account factors such as:

     o    economic conditions;
     o    geographic and agricultural  commodity  concentrations in Farmer Mac's
          portfolio;
     o    the credit profile of Farmer Mac's portfolio;
     o    delinquency trends of Farmer Mac's portfolio;
     o    Farmer  Mac's  experience  in the  management  and sale of real estate
          owned; and
     o    historical   charge-off  and  recovery   activities  of  Farmer  Mac's
          portfolio.

The  allowance  for losses is increased  through  periodic  provisions  for loan
losses that are charged  against net interest  income and  provisions for losses
that are charged to  operating  expense and  reduced by  charge-offs  for actual
losses, net of recoveries.  The establishment of and periodic adjustments to the
REO valuation allowance are charged against income as a portion of the provision
for losses charged to operating  expense.  Charge-offs  represent  losses on the
outstanding  principal  balance,  any interest  payments  previously  accrued or
advanced and expected costs of liquidation.

     No  allowance  for losses has been made for loans  underlying  Farmer Mac I
Guaranteed  Securities  issued prior to the 1996 Act or Farmer Mac II Guaranteed
Securities.  Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities issued prior to the 1996 Act are
supported by unguaranteed first loss subordinated interests,  which are expected
to exceed the estimated credit losses on those loans.  USDA-guaranteed  portions
collateralizing  Farmer Mac II Guaranteed  Securities are obligations  backed by
the full  faith  and  credit  of the  United  States.  To date,  Farmer  Mac has
experienced  no credit  losses  on any  pre-1996  Act  Farmer  Mac I  Guaranteed
Securities or on any Farmer Mac II Guaranteed  Securities and does not expect to
incur any such losses in the future.

     Further  information  regarding  the  allowance  for losses is  included in
"--Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Management--Credit
Risk."

Results of Operations

     Overview.  Net income  available to common  stockholders  for third quarter
2003 was $3.3  million  or $0.28 per  diluted  common  share,  compared  to $5.0
million or $0.42 per diluted common share for third quarter 2002.

     Farmer  Mac's growth  continued in third  quarter  2003,  with  outstanding
guarantee and commitment  volume as of September 30, 2003 more than $441 million
higher than at the close of third  quarter  2002.  During  third  quarter  2003,
Farmer Mac:

     o    added $199.6 million of Farmer Mac I eligible loans under LTSPCs;
     o    purchased  $45.2  million  of newly  originated  Farmer Mac I eligible
          loans; and
     o    purchased $106.7 million of Farmer Mac II guaranteed portions of loans
          guaranteed by USDA.

     USDA is currently  forecasting  national  farm cash receipts to increase to
$205.5 billion in 2003 from the $192.9 billion  forecasted level in 2002. Prices
available to farmers have been rising as a result of strong domestic and foreign
demand.  Forecasted net cash income on farms for 2003 is $60.2 billion,  up 22.6
percent from 2002  forecasted  levels of $49.1 billion.  The forecasted net cash
income on farms for 2003  includes  government  payments  of $19.6  billion,  as
compared to $11.0 billion in 2002.  The increase in government  payments in 2003
vs. 2002 is due to the timing of the payments  resulting from the 2002 Farm Bill
and not a fundamental  structural  change.  Farm real estate debt is expected to
reach $116.4 billion in 2003, up 4.5 percent from the $111.4 billion  forecasted
level in 2002.

     USDA forecasts farm real estate values to rise by approximately 3.0 percent
in 2003.  This  forecast is up from 1.5  percent  earlier  this year,  but still
slightly less than farm real estate  growth of 4.0 percent in 2002,  5.2 percent
in 2001,  and 6.8  percent in 2000.  On average,  farm real  estate  values grew
nearly 4.0  percent  annually  during the 1990s.  Regionally,  farm real  estate
values may vary with differing rates of increase, or even decrease, depending on
differences in land quality and location,  commodities grown, credit conditions,
non-farm  investment  opportunities,  government  farm policies,  and production
risks and weather uncertainties unique to each region's agriculture.

     Set forth below is a more  detailed  discussion  of Farmer Mac's results of
operations.

     Net Interest Income. Net interest income was $8.9 million for third quarter
2003 and $28.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2003, compared to
$11.1 million and $29.6 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2002. The
net interest  yield,  which does not include  guarantee fees for loans purchased
prior to April 1, 2001 (the effective date of Statement of Financial  Accounting
Standards No. 140,  Accounting  for Transfers and Servicing of Financial  Assets
and  Extinguishments  of Liabilities  ("SFAS 140")), was 93 basis points for the
nine months ended September 30, 2003,  compared to 107 basis points for the nine
months ended  September  30, 2002.  The effect of the adoption of SFAS 140 was a
reclassification  of  approximately  $3.3 million (11 basis points) of guarantee
fee income as interest  income for the nine months  ended  September  30,  2003,
compared to $1.7 million (6 basis  points) for the nine months  ended  September
30, 2002.

     During third quarter 2003, the Chief Accountant at the U.S.  Securities and
Exchange Commission  provided  additional guidance to all registrants  regarding
the  classification  on the statement of operations of realized gains and losses
resulting  from  financial  derivatives  that are not in fair value or cash flow
hedge relationships. All registrants were requested to comply with this guidance
in  future  filings  and to  reclassify  this  activity  for all  prior  periods
presented.  As a result of the application of this additional guidance,  the net
interest income and expense  realized on financial  derivatives  that are not in
fair  value or cash flow hedge  relationships  have been  reclassified  from net
interest  income  into gains and losses on  financial  derivatives  and  trading
assets.   For  the  nine  months  ended   September  30,  2003  and  2002,  this
reclassification resulted in the increase of the net interest yield of one basis
point and an increase of 12 basis points, respectively.

     The net interest  yields for the nine months ended  September  30, 2003 and
2002 included the benefits of yield  maintenance  payments  received of 12 basis
points and 10 basis points,  respectively.  Yield maintenance payments represent
the present value of expected  future interest income streams and accelerate the
recognition of interest  income from the related  loans.  Because the timing and
size of  these  payments  vary  greatly,  variations  should  not be  considered
indicative of positive or negative trends to gauge future financial results. For
the nine  months  ended  September  30,  2003 and  2002,  the  effects  of yield
maintenance  payments  on net income and  diluted  earnings  per share were $3.6
million or $0.20 per diluted share and $2.7 million or $0.14 per diluted  share,
respectively.

     The following table provides information regarding the average balances and
rates of interest-earning assets and funding for the nine months ended September
30, 2003 and 2002. The balance of non-accruing  loans is included in the average
balance  of  interest  earning  loans  presented,  though no  related  income is
included in the income figures presented. The decreases in the average rates for
cash and cash equivalents  reflect their short-term nature. The decreases in the
average rates for  investments  and loans and Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities
reflect the  relatively  large  proportion  of  adjustable  rates in those asset
categories (71.7 percent of investments and 64.5 percent of loans and Farmer Mac
Guaranteed Securities). The decrease in the average rate for discount notes also
reflects their short-term  nature. The decreases in all of these rates track the
general decrease in market rates between the two periods.

     The  following  table sets forth  information  regarding the changes in the
components of Farmer Mac's net interest  income for the periods  indicated.  For
each  category,  information is provided on changes  attributable  to changes in
volume (change in volume  multiplied by old rate) and changes in rate (change in
rate  multiplied  by old  volume).  Combined  rate/volume  variances,  the third
element of the  calculation,  are allocated  based on their  relative  size. The
decreases due to rate reflect the short-term or  adjustable-rate  nature of most
assets or liabilities and the general decreases in market rates described above.

     Guarantee and  Commitment  Fees.  Guarantee and  commitment  fees were $5.1
million for third quarter 2003, compared to $4.9 million for third quarter 2002.
The  increase  in  guarantee  and  commitment  fees  reflects an increase in the
average balance of outstanding  guarantees and LTSPCs.  Excluding the effects of
the  adoption  of SFAS 140 that  reclassified  $1.1  million  and $1.0  million,
respectively,  of guarantee fee income as interest income for third quarter 2003
and third quarter 2002, guarantee and commitment fees for third quarter 2003 and
third quarter 2002 would have been $6.2 million and $5.9 million,  respectively.
The  difference  or "spread"  between the cost of Farmer  Mac's debt funding for
loans and Post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities held on its books and
the yield on those  assets is composed of one  component  that  compensates  for
credit  risk,  which would  continue to be received by Farmer Mac as a guarantee
fee if the assets were sold, and another component that compensates for interest
rate risk,  which  would not  typically  continue  to be  received by Farmer Mac
(except to the extent attributable to any retained  interest-only  strip) if the
asset were sold.

     Miscellaneous  Income.  Miscellaneous  income decreased to $0.4 million for
third  quarter 2003 from $0.5 million for third  quarter 2002 due to a reduction
in late fees received.

     Expenses.  Compensation  and employee  benefits for third quarter 2003 were
$1.6 million,  compared to $1.3 million for third quarter 2002. The increase was
due, in large part, to increased staffing levels for  administrative  activities
and  compliance   with   regulatory   requirements,   including   those  of  the
Sarbanes-Oxley  Act of 2002.  General  and  administrative  expenses  for  third
quarter 2003 were $1.6 million, compared to $2.2 million for third quarter 2002.
Regulatory  fees  assessed by Farmer Mac's  federal  regulator,  the Farm Credit
Administration  ("FCA"),  for third quarter 2003 and 2002 were $0.4 million. The
FCA has  advised  Farmer Mac that its  estimated  assessment  level for the year
ending  September  30,  2004  will be $1.7  million,  up from its  $1.4  million
estimated  assessment level for the year ended September 30, 2003. After the end
of a federal  government  fiscal year,  FCA may revise its prior year  estimated
assessments to reflect  actual costs  incurred,  and has issued both  additional
assessments and refunds in the past.

     Farmer Mac's  provision for losses was $2.1 million for third quarter 2003,
compared to $2.0  million  for third  quarter  2002.  (See  "--Quantitative  and
Qualitative   Disclosures  About  Market  Risk   Management--Credit   Risk"  for
additional information regarding Farmer Mac's provision for losses and provision
for loan  losses.) As of September  30, 2003,  Farmer Mac's total  allowance for
losses totaled $22.7 million, or 0.47 percent of outstanding loans held or loans
underlying Post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs, compared
to $20.0  million (0.42 percent of  outstanding  loans held or loans  underlying
Post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities and LTSPCs) as of December 31,
2002.

     Gain on the Repurchase of Debt. During 2002, Farmer Mac recognized gains of
$3.4 million on the repurchase of $62.7 million of  outstanding  Farmer Mac debt
that had a maturity date of October 14, 2011 and an annual  interest rate of 5.4
percent.  Prior to the adoption of SFAS 145 on January 1, 2003, those gains were
presented  as net  after-tax  extraordinary  gains of $2.2  million.  Those debt
securities  were replaced with new fixed-rate  funding to the same maturity date
at more attractive interest rates, which preserves Farmer Mac's  asset-liability
match and reduces future interest expense.  There were no gains or losses on the
repurchase of debt during 2003.

     Gains on Financial  Derivatives and Trading Assets. For third quarter 2003,
the loss on financial derivatives and trading assets was $3.3 million,  compared
to a loss of $2.6 million for third  quarter  2002.  The losses in third quarter
2003 and second  quarter  2002  resulted  primarily  from  decreases in the fair
values of callable interest rate contracts.

     Non-GAAP Performance Measures.  Farmer Mac reports its financial results in
accordance with GAAP. In addition to GAAP measures,  Farmer Mac presents certain
non-GAAP  performance  measures.  Farmer  Mac uses  these  non-GAAP  performance
measures to develop  financial plans, to measure corporate  performance,  and to
set incentive compensation. As described below, because FASB has adopted a mixed
attribute  accounting model that does not reflect the economics for transactions
involving  Farmer  Mac's  callable  swaps,  in  management's  view the  non-GAAP
measures  provide  a more  accurate  representation  of  Farmer  Mac's  economic
performance,  transaction  economics  and  business  trends.  Investors  and the
investment  analyst  community have previously  relied upon similar  measures to
evaluate  performance and issue projections.  These non-GAAP disclosures are not
intended to replace GAAP information but, rather, to supplement it.

     One such non-GAAP  measure is core earnings,  which Farmer Mac developed to
present net income less the after-tax effects of SFAS 133 and less the after-tax
net gains and losses on the  repurchase of debt that,  prior to January 1, 2003,
were  reported as  extraordinary  items.  Core  earnings  for the three and nine
months  ended   September  30,  2003  were  $5.5  million  and  $17.2   million,
respectively,  compared to $5.9 million and $17.0 million for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2002. The reconciliation of GAAP net income available
to common stockholders to core earnings is presented in the following table:

</TABLE>

     Effects of SFAS 133 on Accounting for Callable Interest Rate Swaps.  Farmer
Mac enters into financial derivative transactions principally to protect against
risk from the effects of market price or interest rate movements on the value of
certain  assets  and  future  cash flows or debt  issuance,  not for  trading or
speculative  purposes.  Farmer  Mac enters  into  interest  rate swap  contracts
principally to adjust the  characteristics  of its short-term debt to match more
closely the cash flow and duration  characteristics of its longer-term  mortgage
and other assets,  and also to adjust the  characteristics of its long-term debt
to  match  more  closely  the  cash  flow and  duration  characteristics  of its
short-term assets, thereby reducing interest rate risk.  Specifically,  interest
rate  swaps  convert  economically  the  variable  cash  flows  related  to  the
forecasted issuance of short-term debt to effectively fixed-rate medium-term and
long-term notes that match the anticipated duration, repricing and interest rate
characteristics of the corresponding assets. Since this strategy provides Farmer
Mac with the same cash  flows as those  that are  inherent  in the  issuance  of
medium-term  notes,  Farmer Mac uses  either the bond  market or the swap market
based upon their relative pricing efficiencies.

     Farmer  Mac uses  callable  interest  rate swaps (in  conjunction  with the
issuance of short-term  debt) as an  alternative to callable  medium-term  notes
with equivalently  structured  maturities and call options.  The call options on
the swaps  are  designed  to match  the  implicit  prepayment  options  on those
mortgage  assets without  prepayment  protection.  The blended  durations of the
swaps are also  designed  to match the  duration  of the  mortgages  over  their
estimated  lives.  If the  mortgages  prepay,  the swaps  can be called  and the
short-term  debt  repaid;  if the  mortgages  do not  prepay,  the swaps  remain
outstanding  and the  short-term  debt is  rolled  over,  effectively  providing
fixed-rate callable funding over the lives of the mortgages. Thus, the economics
of the assets are closely matched to the economics of the interest rate swap and
funding combination.

     The callable interest rate swaps are recorded at fair value on Farmer Mac's
balance  sheet  with  the  related  changes  in  fair  value  recognized  in the
consolidated  statement of  operations.  Although  Farmer Mac believes that this
strategy  achieves  its economic and risk  management  objectives,  the FASB has
adopted a mixed  attribute  accounting  model for  callable  swaps that does not
reflect the  economics of the  transactions.  Pursuant to that model,  while the
issuance of a callable  medium-term  note is recorded at  historical  cost,  the
economic  equivalent  (the  issuance  of short  term-debt  with  the  forecasted
rollover of that debt and the simultaneous  issuance of a callable interest rate
swap) is recorded  differently  (the  discount  notes are recorded at historical
cost and the interest rate swap is recorded at fair value).  Despite the closely
matched economics and optionality of the assets and the associated interest rate
swap and  funding  combination,  the  callable  swaps do not  qualify  for hedge
accounting  under SFAS 133 because the test for hedge  effectiveness  under SFAS
133 is based on the linkage  between the forecasted  short-term  funding and the
callable  interest rate swap and ignores the prepayable  characteristics  of the
associated assets being funded.

      Business Volume. Loans are brought into the Farmer Mac I and Farmer Mac II
programs as follows:

     o    Farmer Mac purchases  eligible loans and guarantees timely payments of
          principal and interest of securities  backed by those loans as part of
          the Farmer Mac I program.  Farmer Mac may retain  some or all of those
          securities  in its  portfolio or sell them to third parties in capital
          markets transactions.
     o    Farmer Mac purchases  USDA-guaranteed portions of loans and guarantees
          timely  payments of  principal  and interest of  securities  backed by
          those guaranteed portions as part of the Farmer Mac II program. Farmer
          Mac may retain some or all of those  securities  in its  portfolio  or
          sell them to third parties in capital markets transactions.
     o    Farmer Mac also enters into LTSPCs for  eligible  loans.  Farmer Mac's
          commitments through LTSPCs include either newly originated or seasoned
          eligible loans, and are part of the Farmer Mac I program.
     o    Farmer Mac exchanges  Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities  for eligible
          loans or  USDA-guaranteed  portions of loans  ("swaps").  Farmer Mac's
          swaps of Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities for USDA-guaranteed portions
          of loans are part of the Farmer Mac II program;  Farmer Mac's swaps of
          Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities for any other eligible loans are part
          of the Farmer Mac I program.

     The  following  table  sets forth the amount of all Farmer Mac I and Farmer
Mac II loan purchase and guarantee  activities for newly  originated and current
seasoned loans during the periods indicated.

     The purchase  price of newly  originated  and seasoned  eligible  loans and
portfolios purchased by Farmer Mac (none of which were delinquent at the time of
purchase) is the fair value based on current  market  interest  rates and Farmer
Mac's target net yield,  which  includes an amount to compensate  Farmer Mac for
credit risk that is similar to the guarantee or  commitment  fee it receives for
accepting credit risk on loans underlying  Post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed
Securities  and LTSPCs.  As part of  fulfilling  its guarantee  obligations  for
Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities and assumption of credit risk on commitments
to purchase  eligible loans underlying  LTSPCs,  Farmer Mac purchases  defaulted
loans (all of which are at least 90 days delinquent at the time of purchase) out
of those  securities and pools. The purchase price for defaulted loans purchased
out of Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities is the current outstanding  principal
balance of the loan plus accrued and unpaid  interest.  The  purchase  price for
defaulted loans purchased  under an LTSPC is the current  outstanding  principal
balance of the loan,  with accrued and unpaid  interest on the  defaulted  loans
payable out of any future loan payments or liquidation  proceeds  received.  The

</TABLE>

      The decrease in newly originated and current seasoned loan purchases was
attributable to a decrease in newly originated Farmer Mac I loan purchases and a
large portfolio purchase in second quarter 2002 that has not been replicated in
2003. The increases in defaulted loans purchased and in defaulted loans
transferred to loans reflect:

     o    Farmer Mac's practice of purchasing delinquent loans out of Farmer Mac
          I Guaranteed Securities; and
     o    recordation in the  consolidated  financial  statements of other loans
          over which Farmer Mac regained effective control during the period.

With respect to the second circumstance cited, when particular criteria are met,
such as the default of the borrower,  Farmer Mac becomes  entitled to repurchase
the defaulted  loans  underlying  Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities  (commonly
referred to as "removal-of-account"  provisions). Farmer Mac records these loans
in the consolidated  financial  statements during the period in which Farmer Mac
may  repurchase  the loans and  therefore  regains  effective  control  over the
transferred loans.

     The  weighted-average  age of the Farmer Mac I newly originated and current
seasoned  loans  purchased  during third quarter 2003 and third quarter 2002 was
less than one month and four  months,  respectively.  Of the  Farmer Mac I newly
originated and current  seasoned loans  purchased  during third quarter 2003 and
third  quarter  2002,  54 percent and 71 percent,  respectively,  had  principal
amortization  periods  longer  than the  maturity  date,  resulting  in  balloon
payments at maturity, with a weighted-average remaining term to maturity of 15.0
years and 14.6 years, respectively. The weighted-average age of delinquent loans
purchased  out of  securitized  pools and LTSPCs  during third  quarter 2003 and
third quarter 2002 was 4.2 years and 3.8 years, respectively.

     Indicators of future loan purchase and guarantee  volume (but not of future
LTSPC,  swap  or  portfolio  purchase  volume)  in  the  immediately  succeeding
reporting period include  outstanding  commitments to purchase loans (other than
under an  LTSPC)  and the total  balance  of loans  submitted  for  approval  or
approved but not yet purchased. Many purchase commitments entered into by Farmer
Mac  are  mandatory  delivery  commitments.  If a  seller  obtains  a  mandatory
commitment and is unable to deliver the loans as required thereunder, Farmer Mac
requires the seller to pay a fee to modify, extend or cancel the commitment.  As
of September 30, 2003,  outstanding  commitments to purchase  Farmer Mac I loans
totaled $6.5 million, compared to $12.0 million as of September 30, 2002. Of the
total Farmer Mac I  commitments  outstanding  as of September 30, 2003 and 2002,
$2.1 million and $9.7 million,  respectively,  were mandatory commitments. Loans
submitted  for  approval or approved but not yet  committed to purchase  totaled
$45.9  million  as of  September  30,  2003,  compared  to $69.0  million  as of
September  30,  2002.  Not all of these  loans will be  purchased,  as some will
ultimately be denied for credit reasons or withdrawn by the seller.

     While significant progress has been made in developing the secondary market
for  agricultural  mortgages,  Farmer Mac  continues to face the  challenges  of
establishing a market where none previously existed.  Acceptance of Farmer Mac's
programs is increasing among lenders,  reflecting the competitive  rates,  terms
and products offered and the advantages Farmer Mac's programs provide, including
increased liquidity and lending capacity. As of September 30, 2003, Farmer Mac's
outstanding program volume was $5.6 billion, which represented approximately 12%
of  management's  estimate  of a $46  billion  market of  eligible  agricultural
mortgage loans. For Farmer Mac to succeed in realizing its business  development
and  profitability  objectives  over the longer  term,  the use of Farmer  Mac's
programs and products by agricultural  mortgage lenders,  whether traditional or
non-traditional, must continue to expand.

     New business  volume was down for the first nine months of 2003 compared to
the same period in 2002. Farmer Mac believes this trend is traceable to:

     o    general  conditions  in the  agricultural  mortgage  market  affecting
          agricultural mortgage lenders,  including payments received by farmers
          under the 2002 Farm Bill and lower  short-term  interest  rates,  that
          have resulted in reduced  borrower  inclination  to finance their real
          estate assets, particularly at long-term fixed rates;
     o    diminished  expansion in the capital intensive livestock and permanent
          crop sectors that have, in the past, been  significant  sources of new
          business for Farmer Mac; and
     o    adverse   publicity  about  and  increased   regulatory   pressure  on
          government-sponsored enterprises, including Farmer Mac.

Nonetheless,  lender interest in Farmer Mac produced a consistent  stream of new
volume  in the  form  of  Farmer  Mac I and II  individual  loan  purchases  and
additions to existing LTSPC  arrangements  during the first nine months of 2003.
Farmer Mac believes that prospects for larger portfolio  transactions similar to
those that have  accounted  for a  significant  portion of growth in prior years
continue  to  exist,  but no  assurance  can be  given  at  this  time as to the
certainty or timing of such  transactions.  Thus, the outlook for fourth quarter
2003 is for new volume to continue at the level of recent  quarters.  Looking to
2004,  management  believes the recent release of the October 2003 GAO Report on
Farmer Mac has cleared the way for significant new marketing opportunities.

     As of  September  30,  2003,  there were 135  approved  loan sellers in the
Farmer Mac I program ranging from  single-office  to multi-branch  institutions,
spanning community banks, Farm Credit System  associations,  mortgage companies,
large  multi-state  Farm Credit  System  banks,  commercial  banks and insurance
companies.  As of June 30, 2003,  there were 124 approved  sellers in the Farmer
Mac I program.  During 2002,  there were 79 approved loan sellers  active in the
Farmer Mac I program. In addition to participating  directly in the Farmer Mac I
program,  some of the approved loan sellers  enable other lenders to participate
indirectly  in the Farmer Mac I program by  managing  correspondent  networks of
lenders  from which they  purchase  loans to sell to Farmer Mac. As of September
30, 2003, more than 75 lenders were  participating  in those networks,  bringing
the total Farmer Mac I program participants to more than 200 as of September 30,
2003.

      To be considered for approval as a Farmer Mac I seller, a financial
institution must meet criteria established by Farmer Mac, including:

     o    owning a  requisite  amount  of  Farmer  Mac Class A or Class B voting
          common stock according to a schedule  prescribed for the size and type
          of institution;
     o    having  the  ability  and  experience  to make or  purchase  and  sell
          agricultural mortgage loans of the type that will qualify for purchase
          by Farmer Mac and service such mortgage  loans in accordance  with the
          Farmer  Mac  requirements  either  through  its own  staff or  through
          contractors and originators;
     o    maintaining a minimum adjusted net worth of $1.0 million;
     o    maintaining  a  fidelity  bond  and  errors  and  omissions  insurance
          coverage (or acceptable substitute insurance coverage) in a prescribed
          amount according to the size of the institution; and
     o    entering into a Seller/Servicer  agreement to comply with the terms of
          the Farmer Mac Seller/Servicer  Guide,  including  representations and
          warranties regarding the eligibility of the loans and accuracy of loan
          data provided to Farmer Mac.

     Any lender  authorized by the USDA to obtain a USDA guarantee on a loan may
be a seller in the Farmer Mac II program.  As of September 30, 2003,  there were
193 active sellers in the Farmer Mac II program,  compared to 143 as of December
31, 2002 and 141 as of September 30, 2002.  Sellers in the Farmer Mac II program
consist mostly of community and regional banks.

     In the aggregate,  more than 325 lenders were actively participating either
directly  or  indirectly  in one or both of the  Farmer  Mac I or Farmer  Mac II
programs as of September 30, 2003.

Balance Sheet Review

     During the nine months ended September 30, 2003,  total assets decreased by
$26.5 million from December 31, 2002,  with  decreases in program assets (Farmer
Mac  Guaranteed  Securities  and loans) of $77.3 million  offset by increases in
non-program assets. For further information  regarding on- and off-balance sheet
program  activities,   see  "--Off-Balance   Sheet  Program  Activities"  below.
Consistent  with  the  decrease  in  total  assets  during  the  period,   total
liabilities  decreased by $47.0  million from December 31, 2002 to September 30,
2003.

     During  the  nine  months  ended  September  30,  2003,  accumulated  other
comprehensive income (loss) decreased $1.9 million, which is the net effect of a
$8.1 million decrease in unrealized gains on securities available for sale and a
$6.2 million increase in the fair value of financial  derivatives  classified as
cash  flow  hedges.  Accumulated  other  comprehensive  income  (loss)  is not a
component of Farmer Mac's core capital or regulatory capital.

     As of September 30, 2003, Farmer Mac's core capital totaled $206.4 million,
compared to $184.0  million as of December 31, 2002.  As of September  30, 2003,
core capital  exceeded  Farmer Mac's statutory  minimum  capital  requirement of
$137.7 million by $68.7 million.

     FCA issued its final risk-based  capital regulation for Farmer Mac on April
12,  2001.  Farmer Mac was  required to meet the  risk-based  capital  standards
beginning on May 23, 2002. The risk-based capital stress test promulgated by FCA
is intended to determine  the amount of  regulatory  capital  (core capital plus
allowance  for losses) that Farmer Mac would need to maintain  positive  capital
during a ten-year period in which:

     o    losses occur at a rate of default and severity "reasonably related" to
          the  rates of the  highest  sequential  two  years in a  limited  U.S.
          geographic area; and
     o    there is an  initial  interest  rate  shock at the lesser of 600 basis
          points or 50 percent of the ten-year U.S.  Treasury rate, and interest
          rates remain at such level for the remainder of the period.

The  risk-based  capital  stress test then adds an  additional 30 percent to the
resulting capital requirement for management and operational risk.

     Farmer Mac was in compliance  with the risk-based  capital  standards under
the  regulation  as of  September  30,  2003.  As of  September  30,  2003,  the
risk-based  capital  stress test generated a regulatory  capital  requirement of
$45.5 million.  Farmer Mac's regulatory  capital of $229.1 million exceeded that
amount by approximately  $183.6 million.  The decrease in the risk-based capital
requirement  from December 31, 2002 ($73.4 million) to September 30, 2003 ($45.5
million) was a result of changes in the interest rate environment and the ageing
of Farmer  Mac's loan  portfolio.  Farmer Mac is required to hold capital at the
higher of the statutory  minimum  capital  requirement or the amount required by
the risk-based capital stress test.

Off-Balance Sheet Program Activities

     Farmer Mac offers  approved  agricultural  and rural  residential  mortgage
lenders two  off-balance  sheet  alternatives  to increase  their  liquidity  or
lending  capacity  while  retaining the cash flow  benefits of their loans:  (1)
Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities,  which are available through either the Farmer
Mac I program or the Farmer Mac II program,  and (2) LTSPCs, which are available
only through the Farmer Mac I program.

     To be eligible for the Farmer Mac I program,  a loan must meet Farmer Mac's
credit underwriting,  appraisal and documentation standards. Accordingly, Farmer
Mac  believes  the credit risk it assumes for Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities
backed by loans that are eligible for the Farmer Mac I program and for LTSPCs is
the same and considers the effects of all on- and off-balance  sheet  activities
on its overall portfolio  diversification  and credit risk. See Note 3 to Farmer
Mac's condensed  consolidated  financial statements above for more detail on the
Corporation's off-balance sheet program activities.


Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Management

     Interest  Rate Risk.  Farmer Mac is  subject to  interest  rate risk on all
assets held for investment  because of possible  timing  differences in the cash
flows of the assets and related  liabilities.  This risk is primarily related to
loans held and on-balance sheet Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities because of the
ability of borrowers to prepay their mortgages before the scheduled  maturities,
thereby  increasing the risk of asset and liability cash flow  mismatches.  Cash
flow mismatches in a changing  interest rate environment can reduce the earnings
of the  Corporation  if assets repay sooner than expected and the resulting cash
flows must be reinvested in lower-yielding investments when Farmer Mac's funding
costs  cannot be  correspondingly  reduced,  or if assets repay more slowly than
expected and the associated debt must be replaced by higher-cost debt.

     Yield maintenance  provisions and other prepayment  penalties  contained in
many agricultural  mortgage loans reduce, but do not eliminate,  this prepayment
risk, particularly in the case of a defaulted loan where yield maintenance might
not be  collected.  Those  provisions  require  borrowers to make an  additional
payment when they prepay their loans,  so that, when reinvested with the prepaid
principal, yield maintenance payments generate substantially the same cash flows
that would have been generated had the loan not prepaid. Those provisions create
a  disincentive  to prepayment  and in the event of  prepayment,  compensate the
Corporation  for its interest rate risks to a large degree.  As of September 30,
2003,  55  percent  of the  outstanding  balance  of all  loans  held and  loans
underlying  on-balance  sheet Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities  (including 90
percent  of  all  loans  with  fixed  interest  rates)  were  covered  by  yield
maintenance  provisions and other prepayment penalties.  Of the Farmer Mac I new
and  current  loans  purchased  in third  quarter  2003,  15  percent  had yield
maintenance  or another form of prepayment  protection  (including 13 percent of
all loans with  fixed  interest  rates).  None of the  USDA-guaranteed  portions
underlying Farmer Mac II Guaranteed Securities had yield maintenance provisions.

     Taking  into  consideration  the  prepayment  provisions  and  the  default
probabilities  associated with its mortgage  assets,  Farmer Mac uses prepayment
models to project and value cash flows  associated  with these  assets.  Because
borrowers'  behavior in various interest rate environments may change over time,
Farmer Mac periodically  evaluates the effectiveness of these models compared to
actual prepayment  experience and adjusts and refines the models as necessary to
improve the precision of subsequent  prepayment forecasts.  In addition,  Farmer
Mac consults with independent prepayment experts as part of the model evaluation
process.

     The goal of  Farmer  Mac's  interest-rate-risk  management  is to  create a
portfolio that generates  stable earnings and value across a variety of interest
rate environments. Farmer Mac's primary strategy for managing interest rate risk
is to fund asset purchases with liabilities that have similar  durations so that
they will perform  similarly as interest  rates  change.  To achieve this match,
Farmer Mac issues  discount  notes and  medium-term  notes  across a spectrum of
maturities.  Additionally,  Farmer  Mac  issues  callable  debt  to  offset  the
prepayment  risk  associated  with  some  mortgage  assets.  By using a blend of
liabilities that includes callable debt, the interest rate  sensitivities of the
liabilities  tend to increase or decrease as interest  rates  change in a manner
similar to changes in the interest rate sensitivities of the assets.  Farmer Mac
also uses  financial  derivatives  to better  match the  durations of assets and
liabilities, thereby reducing overall interest rate sensitivity.

     Farmer Mac's $513.4  million of cash and cash  equivalents  as of September
30, 2003 mature within three months and are  match-funded  with  discount  notes
having  similar  maturities.  Investment  securities  of  $1.083  billion  as of
September  30, 2003 consist of $759.0  million  (71.7  percent) of floating rate
securities that all have rates that adjust within one year.  These floating rate
investments  are  funded  using  a  series  of  discount  note  issuances.  Each
successive  discount  note  issuance  matures  on  or  about  the  corresponding
repricing date of the related investment.

     Farmer Mac is also subject to interest rate risk on loans,  including loans
that Farmer Mac has committed to acquire but has not yet purchased.  When Farmer
Mac commits to purchase a loan,  it is exposed to interest rate risk between the
time it commits to purchase the loan and the time it either:

     o    sells Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities backed by the loan; or
     o    issues debt to retain the loan in its portfolio (although issuing debt
          to fund the loan as an investment  does not fully  eliminate  interest
          rate risk due to the possible timing  differences in the cash flows of
          the assets and related liabilities, as discussed above).

Farmer Mac manages the interest rate risk related to such loans, and any related
Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities or debt  issuance,  through the use of forward
sale   contracts   on  the  debt  and   mortgage-backed   securities   of  other
government-sponsored  enterprises and futures contracts  involving U.S. Treasury
securities.  Farmer Mac uses  forward  sale  contracts  on  government-sponsored
enterprise  securities  to reduce its interest  rate exposure to changes in both
Treasury  rates and  spreads  on Farmer  Mac debt and  Farmer  Mac I  Guaranteed
Securities.

     Since interest rate  sensitivity may change with the passage of time and as
interest rates change,  Farmer Mac assesses this exposure on a regular basis and
rebalances its portfolio of assets and liabilities as necessary through:

     o    purchasing mortgage assets in the ordinary course of business;
     o    refunding existing liabilities; or
     o    using derivatives to alter the  characteristics  of existing assets or
          liabilities.

     The most  strenuous  measure  of the  interest  rate risk of  Farmer  Mac's
current  portfolio is the  sensitivity  of its Market Value of Equity ("MVE") to
parallel yield curve shocks. MVE represents the present value of all future cash
flows from on- and off-balance sheet assets,  liabilities,  including  financial
derivatives,  discounted at current  interest  rates and spreads.  The following
schedule  summarizes the results of Farmer Mac's MVE sensitivity  analysis as of
September  30, 2003 and  December  31, 2002 to an  immediate  and  instantaneous
parallel shift in the yield curve.

   *  As of the date indicated, a -200 bp parallel shift of the U.S. Treasury
      yield curve produced negative  interest rates for maturities of 2 years
      and shorter.
</TABLE>

     During 2002 and through third quarter 2003, interest rates fell to historic
lows and interest rate volatility increased significantly.  Despite the volatile
interest  rate  environment,  Farmer Mac  maintained a  relatively  low level of
interest   rate   sensitivity   during  third   quarter  2003  through   ongoing
asset/liability  rebalancing activities.  As of September 30, 2003, Farmer Mac's
effective  duration gap,  another  standard  measure of interest rate risk,  was
minus 0.7 months,  compared to minus 3.6 months as of December  31,  2002,  as a
result of the rebalancing  activities conducted during third quarter 2003. As of
both September 30, 2003 and December 31, 2002, Farmer Mac's MVE and net interest
income ("NII")  showed  positive  sensitivity  to increasing  interest rates and
negative sensitivity to decreases in interest rates.

     As of September  30, 2003,  a uniform or  "parallel"  increase of 100 basis
points would have increased  NII, a shorter-term  measure of interest rate risk,
by 2.3  percent,  while a  parallel  decrease  of 100 basis  points  would  have
decreased NII by 4.7 percent.  Farmer Mac also measures the  sensitivity of both
MVE and  NII to a  variety  of  non-parallel  interest  rate  shocks,  including
flattening and steepening yield curve scenarios. Both MVE and NII continue to be
less  sensitive  to  non-parallel  shocks  than  to  the  parallel  shocks.  The
sensitivity  of  Farmer  Mac's  MVE and NII to both  parallel  and  non-parallel
interest rate shocks,  and its duration gap, are indicators of the effectiveness
of the Corporation's approach to managing its interest rate risk exposures.

     The economic  effects of financial  derivatives,  including  interest  rate
swaps,  are  included in the MVE,  NII and  duration  gap  analyses.  Farmer Mac
generally  enters into various  interest rate swaps to reduce interest rate risk
as follows:

     o    "floating-to-fixed  interest  rate swaps" in which it pays fixed rates
          of  interest  to,  and  receives  floating  rates  of  interest  from,
          counterparties;  these swaps adjust the  characteristics of short-term
          debt to match more closely the cash flow and duration  characteristics
          of longer-term reset and fixed-rate mortgages and other assets and may
          provide  an  overall  lower  effective  cost of  borrowing  than would
          otherwise be available in the conventional debt market;
     o    "fixed-to-floating  interest  rate swaps" in which it  receives  fixed
          rates of  interest  from,  and pays  floating  rates of  interest  to,
          counterparties;  these swaps adjust the  characteristics  of long-term
          debt to match more closely the cash flow and duration  characteristics
          of short-term assets; and
     o    "basis swaps" in which it pays variable rates of interest based on one
          index to, and  receives  variable  rates of interest  based on another
          index from, counterparties; these swaps alter interest rate indices of
          liabilities to match those of assets, and vice versa.

As of September 30, 2003,  Farmer Mac had $1.23 billion combined notional amount
of interest rate swaps with terms ranging from two months to 15 years.  Of those
interest rate swaps,  $695.4 million were  floating-to-fixed  rate interest rate
swaps, $323.9 million were basis swaps and $210.0 million were fixed-to-floating
interest rate swaps.

     Farmer  Mac  employs  financial  derivatives  as an  end-user  for  hedging
purposes,  not for trading or speculative  purposes.  When financial derivatives
meet the specific  hedge  criteria  under SFAS 133,  they are  accounted  for as
either fair value hedges or cash flow hedges.  Financial derivatives that do not
satisfy those hedge  criteria are not accounted for as hedges and changes in the
fair value of those  financial  derivatives  are  reported  as a gain or loss on
financial  derivatives  and trading  assets in the  consolidated  statements  of
operations.  All of Farmer Mac's financial derivative transactions are conducted
under  standard  collateralized  agreements  that limit Farmer  Mac's  potential
credit exposure to any counterparty. As of September 30, 2003, Farmer Mac had no
uncollateralized net exposure to any counterparty.

     Credit Risk.  Farmer Mac's  primary  exposure to credit risk is the risk of
loss resulting  from the inability of a borrower to repay the mortgage  combined
with a  deficiency  in  the  value  of the  collateral  relative  to the  amount
outstanding on the mortgage and the costs of liquidation.  Farmer Mac is exposed
to credit risk on:

     o    loans it holds;
     o    loans underlying Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities; and
     o    loans underlying LTSPCs.

Loans held or loans underlying Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities or LTSPCs can be
divided into four groups:

     o    loans held for investment;
     o    loans underlying pre-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities;
     o    loans underlying  Post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities or
          LTSPCs; and
     o    USDA-guaranteed   portions   underlying   Farmer  Mac  II   Guaranteed
          Securities.

     For loans underlying pre-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities,  ten
percent  first-loss  subordinated  interests  mitigate  Farmer Mac's credit risk
exposure.  Before  Farmer Mac incurs a credit loss,  full recourse must first be
taken  against  the   subordinated   interest.   The  1996  Act  eliminated  the
subordinated interest requirement. As a result, Farmer Mac generally assumes 100
percent of the credit  risk on loans held for  investment  and loans  underlying
Post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs. Farmer Mac's credit
exposure on USDA-guaranteed  portions is covered by the full faith and credit of
the United States.  Farmer Mac believes it has little or no credit risk exposure
to loans underlying  pre-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities because of
the subordinated interests,  or to USDA-guaranteed  portions because of the USDA
guarantee.  The outstanding principal balance of loans held and loans underlying
Farmer  Mac  Guaranteed  Securities  (including  AgVantage  bonds)  or LTSPCs is
summarized in the table below.

     For  several  years,  Farmer  Mac  has  conducted  guarantee  fee  adequacy
analyses,  using stress-test models developed internally and with the assistance
of outside  experts.  These  analyses  have taken into  account  the diverse and
dissimilar  characteristics of the various asset categories for which Farmer Mac
manages its risk exposures,  and have evolved as the mix and character of assets
under management has shifted with growth in the business and the addition of new
asset  categories.  Based on current  information,  Farmer Mac believes that its
guarantee fee is adequate compensation for the credit risk that it assumes.

     Farmer  Mac  has  established  underwriting,  appraisal  and  documentation
standards  for  agricultural  mortgage  loans to mitigate  the risk of loss from
borrower   defaults  and  to  provide   guidance   concerning  the   management,
administration  and conduct of underwriting and appraisals to all  participating
sellers and potential sellers in its programs. These standards were developed on
the basis of industry norms for agricultural  mortgage loans and are designed to
assess  the  creditworthiness  of the  borrower,  as  well as the  value  of the
collateral   securing   the  loan.   Farmer   Mac   requires   sellers  to  make
representations  and warranties  regarding the  conformity of eligible  mortgage
loans to these  standards,  the accuracy of loan data provided to Farmer Mac and
other requirements related to the loans.

     Farmer Mac I credit  underwriting  standards require that the loan-to-value
("LTV") ratio for any loan not exceed 70 percent,  except that a loan secured by
a livestock  facility and supported by a contract with an  integrator  (e.g.,  a
food processing  company) may have an LTV ratio of up to 75 percent, a part-time
farm loan supported by private mortgage insurance may have an LTV ratio of up to
85 percent and a rural housing loan supported by private mortgage  insurance may
have an LTV ratio of up to 97  percent.  Farmer Mac also has a loan  product for
borrowers with high credit scores whose loans are secured by collateral with low
loan-to-value  ratios. For these borrowers,  loan processing has been simplified
and documentation of the credit ratios described above is not necessary.

     In the case of newly-originated  loans that are not part-time farm or rural
housing  loans,  borrowers on the loans must,  among other criteria set forth in
Farmer  Mac's   underwriting   standards,   also  meet  the  following  standard
underwriting  ratios on a pro forma  basis  (that is,  giving  effect to the new
loan):

     o    debt-to-asset ratio of 50 percent or less;
     o    cash flow debt service coverage ratio on the mortgaged property of not
          less than 1:1;
     o    total debt service coverage ratio, including farm and non-farm income,
          of not less than 1.25:1; and
     o    ratio of current assets to current liabilities of not less than 1:1.

     Farmer Mac's underwriting standards provide for acceptance of loans that do
not conform to one or more of the standard  underwriting  ratios, other than LTV
ratio, when those loans:

     o    exceed  one or more of the  underwriting  standards  to a degree  that
          compensates  for  noncompliance  with  one or  more  other  standards,
          referred to as compensating strengths; and
     o    are made to  producers of  particular  agricultural  commodities  in a
          segment  of  agriculture  in which  such  compensating  strengths  are
          typical of the financial condition of sound borrowers in that segment.

Farmer  Mac's use of  compensating  strengths is not intended to provide a basis
for waiving or lessening the requirement that eligible  mortgage loans under the
Farmer Mac I program be of consistently high quality. In fact, loans approved on
the  basis of  compensating  strengths  have not  demonstrated  a  significantly
different  rate of  default  than  that of loans  that  conformed  to all of the
standard credit ratios.  As of September 30, 2003, a total of $1.5 billion (30.4
percent) of the outstanding  balance of loans held and loans  underlying  LTSPCs
and Post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities  were approved  based upon
compensating strengths.  During third quarter 2003, $87.1 million (35.9 percent)
of  the  loans  purchased  or  added  under  LTSPCs  were  approved  based  upon
compensating strengths.

     In the case of a seasoned loan, Farmer Mac considers sustained  performance
to be a reliable  alternative  indicator of a borrower's ability to pay the loan
according to its terms.  A seasoned  loan  generally  will be deemed an eligible
loan if:

     o    it  has  been   outstanding   for  at  least  five  years  and  has  a
          loan-to-value ratio of 60 percent or less;
     o    there  have  been no  payments  on the loan more than 30 days past due
          during the previous three years; and
     o    there have been no material restructurings or modifications for credit
          reasons during the previous five years.

     A seasoned loan that has been  outstanding  for more than one year but less
than five years must  substantially  comply with the underwriting  standards for
newly originated loans as of the date the loan was originated by the lender. The
loan must also have a payment  history  that shows no payment  more than 30 days
past due during the three-year period  immediately prior to the date the loan is
either  purchased  by  Farmer  Mac or made  subject  to an  LTSPC.  As with  the
secondary  market for residential  mortgages,  there is no requirement that each
loan's compliance with the underwriting  standards be re-evaluated  after Farmer
Mac accepts the loan into its program.

      The due diligence Farmer Mac performs before purchasing, guaranteeing
securities backed by, or committing to purchase, seasoned loans includes:

     o    evaluation of loan database information to determine conformity to the
          criteria described above;
     o    confirmation that loan file data conform to database information;
     o    validation of supporting credit information in the loan files; and
     o    review of loan collateral appraisals.

All of the foregoing are performed  through  methods that give due regard to the
size, age, leverage and nature of the collateral for the loans.

     In the case of rural  housing and  part-time  farm loans,  the borrower may
finance up to 97 percent and 85 percent, respectively, of the appraised value of
the  property  if the amount  above 80  percent  is covered by private  mortgage
insurance. For newly originated part-time farm loans, the borrower must generate
sufficient income from all sources to repay all creditors. A borrower's capacity
to repay debt obligations generally is determined by two tests:

     o    the borrower's monthly mortgage  payment-to-income  ratio should be 28
          percent or less; and
     o    the borrower's total monthly debt payment-to-income ratio should be 36
          percent or less.

     Farmer Mac's appraisal standards for newly originated loans require,  among
other things,  that the  appraisal  function be performed  independently  of the
credit  decision-making   process  and  conform  to  the  Uniform  Standards  of
Professional  Appraisal Practice  promulgated by the Appraisal  Standards Board.
Farmer Mac's appraisal  standards require the appraisal function to be conducted
or administered by an individual  meeting specific  qualification and competence
criteria and who:

     o    is not  associated,  except by the engagement for the appraisal,  with
          the credit  underwriters  making the loan  decision,  though  both the
          appraiser  and the credit  underwriter  may be directly or  indirectly
          employed by a common employer;
     o    receives no financial or professional benefit of any kind by virtue of
          the report content,  valuation or credit decision made or based on the
          appraisal product; and
     o    has no present or contemplated  future direct or indirect  interest in
          the appraised property.

The appraisal  standards also require uniform reporting of reliable and credible
opinions   of  the  market   value,   market  rent  and   property   net  income
characteristics of the mortgaged property and the relative market forces.

     Farmer Mac requires current  collateral  valuations in conformance with the
Uniform Standards of Professional  Appraisal Practice for newly originated loans
purchased  or placed  under a Farmer Mac I  Guaranteed  Security  or LTSPC.  For
seasoned loans, Farmer Mac obtains appraisal updates as considered  necessary by
its assessment of collateral risk determined in the due diligence process.

     Farmer Mac  maintains an allowance for losses to cover  estimated  probable
losses on loans  held,  real estate  owned and loans  underlying  Post-1996  Act
Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities  and LTSPCs in accordance  with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies ("SFAS 5") and
Statement of Financial  Accounting Standard No. 114, Accounting by Creditors for
Impairment of a Loan ("SFAS 114"). The methodology for determining the allowance
for  losses  is the same for loans  held for  investment  and  loans  underlying
Post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities  and LTSPCs because Farmer Mac
believes the ultimate credit risk is the same, i.e., the underlying agricultural
mortgage loans all meet the same credit  underwriting  and appraisal  standards.
For  accepting  the credit risk on loans  underlying  Post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I
Guaranteed  Securities  and  LTSPCs,  Farmer  Mac  receives  guarantee  fees and
commitment  fees,  respectively.  For loans held,  Farmer Mac receives  interest
income that includes a component  that  correlates to its guarantee  fee,  which
Farmer Mac views as compensation for accepting credit risk.

     No  allowance  for losses has been made for loans  underlying  Farmer Mac I
Guaranteed  Securities  issued prior to the 1996 Act or Farmer Mac II Guaranteed
Securities.  Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities issued prior to the 1996 Act are
supported by unguaranteed first-loss subordinated interests,  which are expected
to exceed the estimated credit losses on those loans.  USDA-guaranteed  portions
collateralizing  Farmer Mac II Guaranteed  Securities are obligations  backed by
the full  faith  and  credit  of the  United  States.  To date,  Farmer  Mac has
experienced  no credit  losses  on any  pre-1996  Act  Farmer  Mac I  Guaranteed
Securities or on any Farmer Mac II Guaranteed  Securities and does not expect to
incur any such losses in the future.

     Farmer  Mac's   allowance  for  losses  is  presented  as  follows  on  its
consolidated balance sheet:

     o    an "Allowance for loan losses" on loans held for investment;
     o    a valuation  allowance on real estate owned,  which is included in the
          balance sheet under "Real estate owned, net of valuation allowance";
     o    an allowance for losses on loans underlying Post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I
          Guaranteed  Securities  and  LTSPCs  entered  into or  modified  after
          January 1, 2003,  which is included in the balance  sheet as a portion
          of the amount reported as "Guarantee and commitment obligation"; and
     o    an allowance for losses on loans underlying Post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I
          Guaranteed  Securities  and  LTSPCs  entered  into prior to January 1,
          2003,  which is  included  in the balance  sheet  under  "Reserve  for
          losses."

     Farmer Mac's  provision  for losses is presented in two  components  on its
consolidated statement of operations:

     o    a "Provision for loan losses,"  which  represents  estimated  probable
          losses on Farmer Mac's loans held for investment; and
     o    a "Provision for losses," which represents  estimated  probable losses
          on loans underlying  Post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities
          and LTSPCs and real estate owned.

      Farmer Mac estimates probable losses using a systematic process that
begins with management's evaluation of the results of its proprietary loan pool
simulation and guarantee fee model (the "Model"). The Model draws upon
historical information from a data set of agricultural mortgage loans recorded
over a longer period of time than Farmer Mac's own experience to date, screened
to include only those loans with credit characteristics similar to those on
which Farmer Mac has assumed credit risk. The results generated by the Model are
subject to modification by the application of management's judgment that takes
into account factors including:

     o    economic conditions;
     o    geographic and agricultural  commodity  concentrations in Farmer Mac's
          portfolio;
     o    the credit profile of Farmer Mac's portfolio;
     o    delinquency trends of Farmer Mac's portfolio;
     o    Farmer  Mac's  experience  in the  management  and sale of real estate
          owned; and
     o    historical   charge-off  and  recovery   activities  of  Farmer  Mac's
          portfolio.

     Management  believes that its use of this  methodology  produces a reliable
estimate of total probable  losses,  as of the balance sheet date, for all loans
included in Farmer Mac's portfolio,  including loans held, real estate owned and
loans underlying Post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs.

     Farmer Mac expects its methodology for determining its allowance for losses
will  migrate  over time  away  from the Model and be based on Farmer  Mac's own
historical portfolio loss experience.  Until that time, Farmer Mac will continue
to use the results from the Model,  augmented by the application of management's
judgment (as described above), to determine its allowance for losses.

     In  addition,   Farmer  Mac   specifically   analyzes   its   portfolio  of
non-performing  assets  (loans  90  days  or  more  past  due,  in  foreclosure,
restructured,  in  bankruptcy,  including  loans  performing  under either their
original loan terms or a court-approved  bankruptcy plan, and real estate owned)
on a loan-by-loan  basis.  This analysis  measures  impairment based on the fair
value of the  underlying  collateral  for each  individual  loan relative to the
total amount due, including principal,  interest and advances under SFAS 114. In
the event that the updated  appraisal  or  management's  estimate of  discounted
collateral  value does not support the total amount due, Farmer Mac specifically
determines  an allowance  for the loan for the  difference  between the recorded
investment and its fair value, less estimated costs to liquidate the collateral.

     Management  believes that the general  allowance,  which is the  difference
between the total allowance for losses (generated  through use of the Model) and
the specific  allowances,  adequately covers any probable losses inherent in the
portfolio of performing loans under SFAS 5.

     Farmer  Mac  believes  that the  methodology  described  above  produces  a
reliable  estimate  of the total  probable  losses  inherent  in the  Farmer Mac
portfolio. The Model:

     o    uses  historical   agricultural   real  estate  loan  origination  and
          servicing  data that reflect  varied  economic  conditions  and stress
          levels in the agricultural sector;
     o    contains  features that allow variations for changes in loan portfolio
          characteristics  to make the data set  representative  of Farmer Mac's
          portfolio and credit underwriting standards; and
     o    considers  the effects of the ageing of the loan  portfolio  along the
          expected loss curves  associated  with individual  cohort  origination
          years,  including the segments that are entering into or coming out of
          their peak default years.

     Farmer Mac  analyzes  various  iterations  of the Model data and  considers
various  configurations of loan types,  terms,  economic conditions and borrower
eligibility  criteria to generate a distribution of loss exposures over time for
all loans in the  portfolio,  all to evaluate its overall  allowance for losses,
and back tests the results to validate  the Model.  Such tests use prior  period
data  to  project  losses  expected  in  a  current  period  and  compare  those
projections to actual losses incurred during the current period.

     The allowance for losses is increased through periodic  provisions for loan
losses that are charged  against net interest  income and  provisions for losses
charged to operating  expense and reduced by charge-offs for actual losses,  net
of  recoveries  that are  recognized if  liquidation  proceeds  exceed  previous
estimates.  The  establishment of and periodic  adjustments to the REO valuation
allowance  are charged  against  income as a portion of the provision for losses
charged to operating  expense.  Charge-offs  represent losses on the outstanding
principal  balance,  any interest  payments  previously  accrued or advanced and
expected costs of liquidation.


     The  following  table  summarizes  the changes in the  components of Farmer
Mac's  allowance  for losses for the three and nine months ended  September  30,

     During third  quarter 2003,  at the request of a program  participant  (1),
Farmer Mac converted a $722.3 million LTSPC that had been  established  prior to
January 1, 2003 into a Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Security.  In accordance with FIN
45,  Farmer Mac  recorded  the fair value of its  obligation  to stand  ready to
perform  under the new Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Security.  The fair value of this
obligation  includes  Farmer Mac's  estimate of the losses that are  anticipated
over the life of each contractual obligation.  The change in accounting for this
obligation,  from a probable loss model to a fair value model, has resulted in a
reduction in the reserve for losses of approximately $4.9 million.  Since Farmer
Mac believes that these losses remain  probable,  they have been included in the
determination  of the fair value of the  contractual  obligation  and  therefore
there was no reduction in the total allowance for losses.

     When certain criteria are met, such as the default of the borrower,  Farmer
Mac  may  repurchase  the  defaulted  loans  underlying  Farmer  Mac  Guaranteed
Securities  and purchase  those  underlying  an LTSPC.  These  acquisitions  are
recorded in the  consolidated  financial  statements  at their fair value.  Fair
value  is  determined  by  appraisal  or  management's  estimate  of  discounted
collateral  value.  In  September  2002,  Farmer Mac  adopted  EITF issue  02-9,
Accounting  for  Changes  That  Result  in a  Transferor  Regaining  Control  of
Financial Assets Sold ("the consensus" or "EITF 02-9").  The consensus  requires
that Farmer Mac record,  at  acquisition,  the  difference  between  each loan's
acquisition  cost and its fair  value,  if any,  as a charge to the  reserve for
losses. Prior to the adoption of the consensus,  any specific allowance that had
been   established  for  the  off-balance   sheet  obligation  would  have  been
transferred  from the  reserve  for  losses  to the  allowance  for loan  losses
(referred to as "net allocation of the allowance" in the table above).  Upon the
receipt of each  loan's  updated  appraisal  or  determination  of  management's
estimate of discounted  collateral value, the difference between the acquisition
cost of the loan and its fair  value,  if any,  was  recorded as a charge to the
allowance for loan losses.

     Farmer Mac's total  provision for losses was $2.1 million for third quarter
2003,  compared to $2.0 million for third  quarter  2002.  During third  quarter
2003,  Farmer Mac charged off $1.3 million in losses  against the  allowance for
losses and had $0.1 million in recoveries,  for net charge-offs of $1.2 million.
During third quarter 2002, Farmer Mac charged off $1.5 million in losses against
the allowance for losses and recovered $0.3 million from previously  charged off
losses,  for net  charge-offs  of $1.2 million.  The net  charge-offs  for third
quarter 2003 and 2002 included zero and $0.4 million,  respectively,  related to
previously  accrued or advanced  interest  on loans and Farmer Mac I  Guaranteed
Securities.  As of September 30, 2003, Farmer Mac's allowance for losses totaled
$22.7 million, or 47 basis points of the outstanding  principal balance of loans
held and loans underlying  Post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities and
LTSPCs, compared to $20.0 million (42 basis points) as of December 31, 2002.

     As of September  30, 2003,  loans held and loans  underlying  Post-1996 Act
Farmer Mac I  Guaranteed  Securities  and LTSPCs  that were 90 days or more past
due, in foreclosure,  restructured after delinquency,  in bankruptcy  (including
loans  performing  under either their  original  loan terms or a  court-approved
bankruptcy plan) and real estate owned ("Post-1996 Act  non-performing  assets")
totaled $84.6 million and represented  1.74 percent of the principal  balance of
all loans  held and loans  underlying  Post-1996  Act  Farmer  Mac I  Guaranteed
Securities and LTSPCs,  compared to $91.3 million (2.03 percent) as of September
30, 2002. Loans that have been restructured after delinquency were insignificant
and are included within the reported 90-day delinquency and non-performing asset
disclosures. As of September 30, 2003, Farmer Mac's 90-day delinquencies totaled
$47.1 million and represented 0.98 percent of the principal balance of all loans
held and loans underlying  Post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities and
LTSPCs,  compared to $79.8 million (1.77 percent) as of September 30, 2002. From
quarter to  quarter,  Farmer  Mac  anticipates  that  90-day  delinquencies  and
non-performing assets will fluctuate, both in dollars and as a percentage of the
outstanding  portfolio,  with higher  levels  likely at the end of the first and
third quarters of each year  corresponding  to the semi-annual  (January 1st and
July 1st) payment characteristics of most Farmer Mac I loans.

</TABLE>

     As of September  30, 2003,  approximately  $1.8 billion  (36.1  percent) of
Farmer Mac's  outstanding  loans held and loans underlying  Post-1996 Act Farmer
Mac I  Guaranteed  Securities  and  LTSPCs  were in their peak  delinquency  and
default  years  compared  to $1.8  billion  (39.0  percent)  of such loans as of
September  30,  2002.  The  Model  takes  the  portfolio  age  distribution  and
maturation  into  consideration.   Accordingly,   those  trends  did  not  cause
management to alter the Model's projection for the provisions for losses.

     As of September 30, 2003, Farmer Mac's  loan-by-loan  analysis of its $84.6
million of  non-performing  assets and their updated  appraisals or management's
estimates  of  discounted  collateral  values  indicated  that $68.0  million of
non-performing assets were adequately collateralized, and that the allocation of
specific allowances to those loans was not necessary.  Farmer Mac's loan-by-loan
analyses indicated that the remaining $16.6 million had insufficient  collateral
to cover  the loan  balance,  accrued  interest  and  expenses.  Farmer  Mac has
specifically allocated $3.4 million of allowances to those  under-collateralized
loans. As of September 30, 2003, after the allocation of specific  allowances to
under-collateralized  loans,  Farmer Mac had remaining  non-specific  or general
allowances  and contingent  obligations  for inherent  probable  losses of $19.3
million relating to inherent probable loss in the portfolio,  bringing the total
allowance  for  losses  to $22.7  million.  Based on Farmer  Mac's  loan-by-loan
analyses and loan collection  experience,  Farmer Mac believes that specific and
inherent probable losses are covered adequately by the allowance for losses.

      The following table summarizes Farmer Mac's non-performing assets and
allowance for losses:

</TABLE>

     Original  loan-to-value ratios are one of many factors Farmer Mac considers
in evaluating  loss  severity.  Other factors  include,  but are not limited to,
other  underwriting  standards,  commodity  and farming  forecasts  and regional
economic and agricultural conditions.  Loans in the Farmer Mac I program are all
first  mortgage  agricultural  real  estate  loans.  Accordingly,  Farmer  Mac's
exposure on a loan is limited to the difference between the total of the accrued
interest,  advances  and  principal  balance  of a loan  and  the  value  of the
property.  Measurement  of that excess or  shortfall is the best  predictor  and
determinant of loss compared to other measures that evaluate the efficiency of a
particular farm operator.

     Loan-to-value  ratios depend upon the economic value of a property with due
regard for its income-producing  potential in the hands of a competent operator.
As required by Farmer  Mac's  collateral  valuation  standards,  an appraisal of
agricultural   real  estate  must  include  analysis  of  the  income  producing
capability  of the  property  and  address  the  income  estimate  in the market
analysis. Debt service ratios depend upon farm operator efficiency and leverage,
which  can  vary  widely  within  a  geographic  region,  commodity  type  or an
operator's business and farming skills.

     As of September 30, 2003, the weighted-average original loan-to-value ratio
for all loans held and loans  underlying  Post-1996  Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed
Securities  and  LTSPCs  was  49  percent,  and  the  weighted-average  original
loan-to-value ratio for all Post-1996 Act non-performing assets was 56 percent.

     The following table summarizes the Post-1996 Act  non-performing  assets by
original  loan-to-value ("LTV") ratio (calculated by dividing the loan principal
balance at the time of guarantee,  purchase or commitment by the appraised value
at the date of loan origination or, when available,  updated  appraised value at
the time of guarantee, purchase or commitment):

</TABLE>

     An analysis  of Farmer  Mac's  historical  losses and  identified  specific
collateral  deficiencies  within the portfolio (by  origination  year) indicates
that  Farmer Mac has  experienced  peak loss  years as loans  have aged  between
approximately their third and fifth years subsequent to origination,  regardless
of the year the loans were added to the Farmer Mac's portfolio. As a consequence
of the combination of principal  amortization and collateral value appreciation,
there  are few  loans  in the  portfolio  originated  prior to 1996  with  known
collateral deficiencies.  While Farmer Mac expects that there will be loans that
have aged  past  their  fifth  year that will  become  delinquent  and  possibly
default, Farmer Mac does not anticipate significant losses on such loans.

     Analysis of the  portfolio by its  geographic  and  commodity  distribution
indicates that losses and collateral  deficiencies have been and are expected to
remain most  prevalent  in the loans  concentrated  in  commodities  that do not
receive  significant  government  support.  This  analysis  is  consistent  with
corresponding   commodity   analysis,   which  indicates  that  Farmer  Mac  has
experienced higher loss and collateral  deficiency rates in its loans classified
as permanent  plantings.  Most of the loans classified as permanent plantings do
not receive significant government support and are therefore more susceptible to
adverse  commodity-specific   economic  trends.  Further,  as  adverse  economic
conditions  persist  for  a  particular  commodity  that  requires  a  long-term
improvement on the land, such as permanent plantings, the prospective sale value
of  the  land  is  likely  to  decrease   and  the  related   loans  may  become
under-collateralized.  Farmer  Mac  anticipates  that  one  or  more  particular
commodity  groups will be under  economic  pressure at any one time and actively
manages its portfolio to mitigate  concentration  risks while preserving  Farmer
Mac's ability to meet the financing needs of all commodity groups.

     Farmer Mac's  methodologies  for pricing its guarantee and commitment fees,
managing credit risks and providing adequate  allowances for losses consider all
of the foregoing factors and information.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

     Farmer Mac has  sufficient  liquidity and capital  resources to support its
operations  for the next twelve  months and has a  contingency  funding  plan to
handle unanticipated disruptions in its access to those resources.

     Debt Issuance.  Section 8.6(e) of Farmer Mac's statutory charter (12 U.S.C.
ss.  2279aa-6(e))  authorizes  Farmer Mac to issue debt  obligations to purchase
eligible  mortgage  loans and Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities and to maintain
reasonable amounts for business operations, including adequate liquidity. Farmer
Mac funds its  program  operations  primarily  by issuing  debt  obligations  of
various maturities in the public capital markets.  Farmer Mac's debt obligations
consist  of  discount  notes  and  medium-term  notes  issued  to  obtain  funds
principally  to cover the costs of purchasing  and holding loans and  securities
(including  Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities).  Farmer Mac also issues discount
notes and medium-term  notes to obtain funds for investments,  transaction costs
and guarantee payments.  The Corporation's  discount notes and medium-term notes
are  obligations  of Farmer Mac only, are not rated by any rating agency and the
interest and principal thereon are not guaranteed by and do not constitute debts
or obligations of FCA or the United States or any agency or  instrumentality  of
the United  States other than Farmer Mac.  Farmer Mac is an  institution  of the
Farm Credit  System,  but is not liable for any debt or  obligation of any other
institution of the Farm Credit System. Likewise,  neither the Farm Credit System
nor any other individual institution of the Farm Credit System is liable for any
debt or  obligation  of Farmer Mac.  Income on Farmer Mac's  discount  notes and
medium-term notes has no tax exemption under federal law from federal,  state or
local taxation.

     Farmer Mac's board of directors has  authorized  the issuance of up to $5.0
billion of  discount  notes and  medium-term  notes (of which $3.8  billion  was
outstanding  as of  September  30,  2003),  subject  to  periodic  review of the
adequacy of that level relative to Farmer Mac's borrowing  requirements.  Farmer
Mac  invests the  proceeds of such  issuances  in loans,  Farmer Mac  Guaranteed
Securities  and  non-program  investment  assets in accordance  with  guidelines
established by its board of directors.

     Liquidity.  The  funding  and  liquidity  needs of  Farmer  Mac's  business
programs are driven by the purchase and  retention of eligible  loans and Farmer
Mac  Guaranteed  Securities,  the  maturities of Farmer Mac's discount notes and
medium-term notes and payment of principal and interest on Farmer Mac Guaranteed
Securities. Farmer Mac's primary sources of funds to meet these needs are:

     o    principal and interest  payments and ongoing  guarantee and commitment
          fees received on loans, Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs;
     o    principal and interest payments  received from investment  securities;
          and
     o    the issuance of discount  notes and  medium-term  notes in the capital
          markets.

     Farmer Mac  projects  its  expected  cash flows from loans and  securities,
other earnings and the sale of assets and matches those with its  obligations to
retire  debt and pay  other  liabilities  as they come due.  Farmer  Mac  issues
discount  notes  and  medium-term  notes to meet the needs  associated  with its
business operations,  including liquidity,  and also to increase its presence in
the capital markets in order to enhance the liquidity and pricing  efficiency of
its discount notes and  medium-term  notes and Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities
transactions  and so improve the mortgage rates  available to farmers,  ranchers
and rural homeowners.

     Though Farmer Mac's mortgage  purchases do not currently  necessitate daily
debt issuance,  the Corporation  continued its strategy of using its non-program
investment  portfolio  (referred  to as Farmer  Mac's  liquidity  portfolio)  to
facilitate  increasing its ongoing  presence in the capital markets during 2003.
To meet investor  demand for daily  presence in the capital  markets  Farmer Mac
issues  discount notes in maturities  ranging from one day to  approximately  90
days and  invests  the  proceeds  not  needed for  program  asset  purchases  in
highly-rated  securities.  Investments are predominantly short-term money market
securities with  maturities  closely matched to the discount note maturities and
floating-rate  securities  with  reset  terms of less than one year and  closely
matched to the maturity of the discount  notes.  The positive spread earned from
these  investments  enhances the net interest  income Farmer Mac earns,  thereby
improving the net yields at which Farmer Mac can purchase mortgages from lenders
who may pass that benefit to farmers,  ranchers and rural homeowners through the
Farmer Mac programs.  Subject to dollar, issuer concentration and credit quality
limitations,  the  Corporation's  board of directors has authorized  non-program
investments in:

     o    U.S. treasury obligations;
     o    agency and instrumentality obligations;
     o    repurchase agreements;
     o    commercial paper;
     o    guaranteed investment contracts;
     o    certificates of deposit;
     o    federal funds and bankers acceptances;
     o    certain  securities  and debt  obligations  of corporate and municipal
          issuers;
     o    asset-backed securities;
     o    corporate money market funds; and
     o    preferred stock of government-sponsored enterprises.

As of September 30, 2003,  Farmer Mac was in compliance with the dollar,  issuer
concentration and credit quality  limitations and investment  authorizations set
forth in its investment guidelines.

     As a result  of  Farmer  Mac's  regular  issuance  of  discount  notes  and
medium-term notes and its status as a federally chartered instrumentality of the
United  States,  Farmer  Mac has been  able to access  the  capital  markets  at
favorable  rates.  During  2003 and  throughout  the  period of  inaccurate  and
misleading  publicity about the Corporation  during 2002,  Farmer Mac maintained
regular  daily access to the  discount  note market at rates  comparable  to the
issuance and trading levels of other  government-sponsored  enterprise  discount
notes. Farmer Mac's continued ability to access the discount note market at such
favorable rates could be affected by further inaccurate and misleading publicity
about Farmer Mac or unusual trading in its securities.  Farmer Mac believes such
factors  caused spread  levels in secondary  market  trading of its  outstanding
medium-term  notes to widen during  second  quarter  2002.  Although  Farmer Mac
returned  to  issuing  medium-term  notes at  favorable  issuance  spreads,  the
foregoing  factors  could  affect  future   medium-term  note  issuance  spreads
adversely  and cause Farmer Mac to  emphasize  floating-to-fixed  interest  rate
swaps, combined with discount note issuances, as a source of fixed-rate funding.
While the swap market may  provide  favorable  fixed  rates,  swap  transactions
expose  Farmer Mac to the risk of future  widening of its own  issuance  spreads
versus  corresponding  LIBOR  rates.  If the spreads on the Farmer Mac  discount
notes  were to  increase  relative  to LIBOR,  Farmer  Mac would be exposed to a
commensurate  reduction on its net interest yield on the notional  amount of its
floating-to-fixed  interest  rate  swaps and  other  LIBOR-based  floating  rate
assets.  Farmer Mac  compensates for this risk by pricing the required net yield
on program  asset  purchases to reflect the cost of  medium-term  notes  without
regard to the savings that may be achievable in the interest rate swap market.

     Farmer Mac maintains an investment  portfolio of cash and cash  equivalents
(including  commercial paper and other short-term money market  instruments) and
investment securities consisting mostly of floating rate securities that reprice
within one year,  which can be drawn upon for liquidity  needs.  As of September
30,  2003,  Farmer Mac's cash and cash  equivalents  and  investment  securities
totaled $513.4 million and $1.1 billion,  respectively,  a combined 38.1 percent
of total assets.  For third quarter 2003,  exclusive of daily overnight discount
note issuances that were invested overnight,  the average discount note issuance
term and re-funding frequency was approximately 66 days.

transactions, including financial derivatives, and by monitoring its exposure to
changes  in  interest  rates.  See  "Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of
Financial  Condition  and Results of  Operations--Quantitative  and  Qualitative
Disclosures  About  Market  Risk   Management--Interest   Rate  Risk"  for  more

Item 4. Controls and Procedures

     Farmer Mac maintains  disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed in the Corporation's  periodic filings
under the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"),  including this

disclosure  controls and procedures include controls and procedures  designed to
ensure that  information  required to be  disclosed  under the  Exchange  Act is
accumulated and communicated to the  Corporation's  management on a timely basis
to allow decisions regarding required  disclosure.  Farmer Mac's Chief Executive
Officer and Chief  Financial  Officer have  evaluated the  effectiveness  of the
design and operation of the Corporation's disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined under Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of September
30, 2003. Based upon that evaluation,  Farmer Mac's Chief Executive  Officer and
Chief  Financial  Officer  have  concluded  that  the  Corporation's  disclosure
controls and procedures  are adequate and effective.  There have been no changes
in Farmer Mac's internal  control over financial  reporting that occurred during
the quarter  ended  September  30, 2003 that have  materially  affected,  or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, the Corporation's internal controls over
financial reporting.

                  FEDERAL AGRICULTURAL MORTGAGE CORPORATION
                   AMENDED AND RESTATED 1997 INCENTIVE PLAN


1.    Purpose of the Plan

     The purposes of this Amended and Restated 1997  Incentive Plan (the "Plan")
are to encourage  stock ownership by directors,  officers,  and key employees of
the  Federal   Agricultural   Mortgage   Corporation  (the  "Company")  and  its
subsidiaries, to provide an incentive for such individuals to expand and improve
the profits and  prosperity of the Company and its  subsidiaries,  and to assist
the Company and its  subsidiaries in attracting and retaining  directors and key
personnel through the grant of Options (as defined herein) to purchase shares of
the Company's  Class C nonvoting  common  stock,  par value $1.00 per share (the
"Common Stock").

2.    Persons Eligible Under Plan

     Any person who is an officer or employee  of the Company or any  subsidiary
(as defined in Sections 424(f) and 424(g) of the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (a  "Subsidiary"),  shall be  eligible  for awards  under the Plan (a
"Participant").  Any  member  of the Board of  Directors  (the  "Board")  of the
Company (a  "Director")  who is not also an  employee  of the  Company  shall be
eligible  to receive  any awards  only under  Section 15 of the Plan  ("Director
Options").

3.    Stock Subject to Plan

     Subject to Section 10, the maximum number of shares that may be the subject
of awards  under the Plan  shall be  3,750,000  shares of the  Company's  Common
Stock,  which shall be made available either from authorized but unissued Common
Stock or from Common Stock reacquired by the Company, including shares purchased
in the open market. If any award granted under the Plan is canceled,  forfeited,
or otherwise  terminates or expires for any reason without having been exercised
in full, the shares of Common Stock allocable to the unexercised portion of such
award may again be the subject of grants under the Plan.

4.    Administration of Plan

     (a) Except for the  provisions  of Section 15 (which to the maximum  extent
feasible shall be self-effectuating),  the Plan shall be administered by (i) the
Board of Directors for any purpose under the Plan, (ii) a committee of the Board
consisting of two or more Directors,  each of whom is a "Non-Employee  Director"
under  Securities  Exchange Act Rule 16b-3,  for any purpose  under the Plan, or
(iii) a committee of the Board  consisting of two or more Directors  (whether or
not any such Director is a  "Non-Employee  Director")  for purposes of any award
under the Plan to an employee other than an officer subject to Section 16 of the
Securities  Exchange Act of 1934 (it being understood and agreed that references
herein to the "Committee"  shall mean the Board or either committee  referred to
above, as the case may be).

     (b) Subject to the express  provisions of the Plan, the Committee  shall be
authorized  and empowered to do all things  necessary or desirable in connection
with  the  administration  of  the  Plan,  including,  without  limitation,  the
following:

          (i)  interpret  and construe the Plan and the terms and  conditions of
     any award hereunder;

          (ii)  adopt,   amend,  and  rescind  rules  and  regulations  for  the
     administration of the Plan;

          (iii)  determine  which persons meet the  eligibility  requirements of
     Section 2 hereof and to which of such eligible persons, if any, awards will
     be granted hereunder;

          (iv) grant  awards to  eligible  persons and  determine  the terms and
     conditions thereof,  including, but not limited to, the number of shares of
     Common Stock  issuable  pursuant  thereto,  the time not more than 10 years
     after the date of an award at which time the award shall  expire or (if not
     vested) terminate,  and the conditions upon which awards become exercisable
     or vest or shall expire or terminate, and the consideration,  if any, to be
     paid upon receipt, exercise or vesting of awards;

          (v)  determine  whether,  and the  extent  to which,  adjustments  are
     required pursuant to Section 10 hereof;

          (vi)  determine the  circumstances  under which,  consistent  with the
     provisions of Section 11, any outstanding award may be amended;

          (vii)  exercise its  discretion  with respect to the powers and rights
     granted to it as set forth in the Plan; and

          (viii) generally, exercise such powers and perform such acts as deemed
     necessary or  advisable  to promote the best  interests of the Company with
     respect to the Plan.

     (c) Any action  taken by, or inaction  of the  Company,  the Board,  or the
Committee  relating  or  pursuant  to the  Plan,  shall be within  the  absolute
discretion of that entity or body and shall be  conclusive  and binding upon all
persons.  No member of the Board or officer of the  Company  shall be liable for
any such action or inaction of: (i) the entity or body; (ii) another person;  or
(iii) except in circumstances involving bad faith, himself or herself. In making
any  determination  or in taking or not taking any  action  under the Plan,  the
Board and the  Committee  may obtain  and may rely upon the  advice of  experts,
including professional advisors to the Company.

     (d) The Committee may delegate ministerial,  non-discretionary functions to
individuals who are officers or other employees of the Company.

5.    Awards

     (a) Awards under the Plan shall consist of options  ("Options") to purchase
the Common Stock of the Company and shall be evidenced by agreements (the "Award
Agreements") in such form as the Committee shall approve.

     (b) The exercise  price per share shall be 100% of the Fair Market Value of
one  share of Common  Stock on the date the  Option is  granted  (the  "Exercise
Price"),  subject to  adjustment  only as provided in Section 10 of the Plan. As
used in the Plan, the term "Fair Market Value" shall mean the composite  closing
price of the Company's  Common Stock as reported on the National  Association of
Securities Dealers Automated Quotations system ("NASDAQ"),  or such other market
on which  the  Common  Stock  may be  listed or  traded,  as  determined  by the
Committee.  If there is not a composite  closing price quotation for the date as
of which Fair Market Value is to be determined, then the Fair Market Value shall
be determined by reference to the composite closing price quotation for the next
preceding day on which a composite closing price quotation is available.

     (c) In connection  with  establishing  the level of Option awards under the
Plan, the value of an Option shall be calculated by an  independent  third party
acceptable to the Committee (the  "Compensation  Consultant") and shall be based
on  the  "Black-Scholes"  method  of  option  valuation,  as  determined  by the
Compensation  Consultant.  In calculating the Black-Scholes  value of an Option,
the average of the composite  closing  prices of the  Company's  Common Stock as
reported by NASDAQ, or such other market on which the Common Stock may be listed
or traded, as determined by the Committee,  for the 90-day period preceding such
calculation  shall be the used by the  Compensation  Consultant  as the "current
market price" and "exercise  price"  inputs to such  Black-Scholes  calculation,
irrespective  of the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the date of
calculation.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  the Exercise Price of any Option
awarded  under the Plan  shall be the Fair  Market  Value of one share of Common
Stock on the date the Option is granted, as provided in subsection (b) above.

6.    Exercise of Options

     (a) Options may be  exercised  in whole or in part at such time or times as
shall be  determined  by the  Committee  and set forth in the  applicable  Award
Agreement.  A  Participant  electing to exercise  an Option  shall give  written
notice to the Company of such election and of the number of shares he or she has
elected to purchase,  and shall at the time of exercise tender the full Exercise
Price for those shares.

     (b) The  Exercise  Price  shall be payable  in cash or by check;  provided,
however,  that to the extent  provided in the applicable  Award  Agreement,  the
Participant  may pay the Exercise Price in whole or in part (i) by delivering to
the  Company  shares of the Common  Stock  owned by him and having a Fair Market
Value on the date of exercise  equal to the Exercise Price of the Option or (ii)
by reducing  the number of shares of Common  Stock  issuable or payable upon the
exercise  of an Option by the  number  of shares of Common  Stock  having a Fair
Market Value on the date of exercise  equal to the Exercise Price of the Option.
In  addition,  the Options may be exercised  through a registered  broker-dealer
pursuant to such cashless  exercise  procedures  (other than share  withholding)
that are, from time to time, deemed  acceptable.  No fractional shares of Common
Stock  shall be issued  upon  exercise  of an Option and the number of shares of
Common Stock that may be purchased upon exercise shall be rounded to the nearest
number of whole shares.

     (c) At such times as a Participant  recognizes taxable income in connection
with the receipt of shares of Common Stock  hereunder (a "Taxable  Event"),  the
Participant  shall pay to the Company the amount of taxes  required by law to be
withheld by the Company in connection  with the Taxable Event (the  "Withholding
Taxes") prior to the issuance of such shares.  In satisfaction of the obligation
to pay the Withholding Taxes to the Company,  the Participant may make a written
election  (the  "Tax  Election"),  which  may be  accepted  or  rejected  in the
discretion of the Committee,  to have withheld a portion of the shares of Common
Stock then issuable to him or her having an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to
the Withholding Taxes.

7.    Right of First Refusal

     The  Committee  may,  in its  discretion,  include  in any Award  Agreement
relating to an Option  granted under the Plan a condition  that the  Participant
shall  agree to  grant  the  Company  a Right of  First  Refusal,  which,  if so
included, shall have the following terms and conditions:

     (a) The  Participant  shall give the  Company  written  notice  (the "Offer
Notice")  of the  Participant's  intention  to sell any  shares of Common  Stock
acquired (or to be acquired) upon exercise of an Option (the "Offered  Shares").
The Company shall have three  business days (the  "Exercise  Period")  following
receipt of the Offer Notice to determine  whether to exercise its Right of First
Refusal,  which may be  exercised  either as to all or as to none of the Offered
Shares. By the end of the Exercise Period,  the Company shall have given written
notice to the Participant of its election to exercise (the "Acceptance  notice")
or not to exercise  (the  "Rejection  Notice") its Right of First  Refusal.  The
Participant  shall tender the Offered  Shares to the Company  within 10 business
days after receipt of an Acceptance Notice.  Upon receipt of a Rejection Notice,
the  Participant  may sell the  Offered  Shares  free and clear of such Right of
First Refusal.

     (b) The price to be paid by the Company for the Offered Shares shall be the
average of the closing price of the Company's Common Stock as reported on NASDAQ
(or such  other  market on which the Common  Stock may be listed or  traded,  as
determined by the Committee) for the three business days  immediately  preceding
the  date  of  the  Company's  receipt  of  the  Offer  Notice  or,  if no  such
transactions occurred on those days, the average of the bid and asked prices for
the Common Stock on such days.

8.    Transfer Restrictions

     (a) Unless  otherwise  permitted in the  applicable  Award  Agreement,  any
Option  granted under the Plan shall not be  transferable  other than by will or
the laws of descent and distribution or pursuant to a domestic  relations order,
and during a Participant's lifetime shall be exercisable only by the Participant
or his or her guardian or legal  representative.  The terms of such Option shall
be final,  binding  and  conclusive  upon the legal  representatives,  heirs and
successors of the Participant.

     (b)  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  the Committee may, in its discretion,
authorize  all or a portion of the  Options to be granted to an  Optionee  to be
transferred to: (i) the spouse, siblings,  parents, children or grandchildren of
the  Optionee  ("Immediate  Family  Members");  (ii) a trust or  trusts  for the
exclusive  benefit of such Immediate  Family Members;  or (iii) a partnership in
which such Immediate  Family Members are the only partners;  provided,  however,
that (x)  there may be no  consideration  for any such  transfer,  (y) the Award
Agreement  pursuant to which the Options are granted must expressly  provide for
transferability  in a manner  consistent  with this Section 8 and (z) subsequent
transfers of transferred Options shall be prohibited, except those in accordance
with the  subsection  (a) above.  Following  transfer,  any such  Options  shall
continue  to be  subject  to the same terms and  conditions  as were  applicable
immediately prior to transfer, provided that the term "Optionee" shall be deemed
to refer to the transferee.

9.    Termination of Employment

     (a) Except as provided in the Award  Agreement  and as provided in Sections
9(b), (c) or (d) below, if a Participant ceases for any reason to be employed by
the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries  (unless such  termination of employment
was for  "Cause"),  the  Participant  may,  at any time within 90 days after the
effective date of such termination of employment, exercise his or her Options to
the extent that he or she would be entitled to exercise  them on such date,  but
in no event shall any Option be exercisable  more than 10 years from the date it
was granted; provided,  however, that the Committee shall have the discretion to
determine  whether  Options not yet  exercisable  at the date of  termination of
employment  shall become  immediately  exercisable for 90 days  thereafter.  The
Committee shall determine, subject to applicable law, whether a leave of absence
shall constitute a termination of service.

     (b) If a  Participant  ceases to be  employed  by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for "Cause," the Participant's  unexercised Options shall terminate
immediately.  For purposes of this Section 9, "Cause" shall be defined as in the
employment agreement,  if any, between the Company and such Participant,  or, if
there is no  employment  agreement,  shall mean (i) the  willful  failure of the
Participant  substantially  to perform  his or her  duties,  other than any such
failure  resulting from incapacity due to physical or mental illness or (ii) the
willful  engagement  by the  Participant  in  activities  contrary  to the  best
interests of the Company.

     (c) Unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement, if a Participant dies
while  employed  by the  Company or any of its  Subsidiaries,  or within 90 days
after  having  retired  with the consent of the  Company,  the shares  which the
Participant  was  entitled to exercise  on the date of the  Participant's  death
under an Option or Options  granted  under the Plan may be exercised at any time
after  the  Participant's  death  by the  Participant's  beneficiary;  provided,
however,  that no Option may be exercised  after the earlier of (i) one (1) year
after the  Participant's  death or (ii) the  expiration  date  specified for the
particular  Option in the  Award  Agreement;  and  provided,  further,  that any
unvested  Option  or  Options  shall  immediately  vest  upon  the  death  of  a
Participant  while  employed by the Company and may be  exercised as provided in
this Section 9(c).

     (d) Unless  otherwise  provided in the Award  Agreement,  if a  Participant
terminates   employment  by  reason  of  Disability  (as  defined  below),   any
unexercised Option held by the Participant shall, if unvested,  immediately vest
and  shall  expire  one (1) year  after the  Participant  has a  termination  of
employment because of such "Disability" and such Option may only be exercised by
the  Participant  or his or her  beneficiary  to the extent  that the Option was
exercisable  on  the  date  of   termination  of  employment   because  of  such
"Disability;" provided, however, no Option may be exercised after the expiration
date specified for the particular  Option in the Award  Agreement.  "Disability"
shall mean (a) in the case of a Participant whose employment with the Company or
a Subsidiary  is subject to the terms of an  employment  agreement  between such
Participant and the Company or Subsidiary, which employment agreement includes a
definition of  "Disability",  the term  "Disability" as used in this Plan or any
Award Agreement  shall have the meaning set forth in such  employment  agreement
during the period that such employment  agreement remains in effect;  and (b) in
all  other  cases,  the  term  "Disability"  as used in this  Plan or any  Award
Agreement shall mean a condition that (in the opinion of an independent  medical
consultant)  has rendered the  Participant  mentally or physically  incapable of
performing  the services  required to be performed  by the  Participant  and has
resulted in the termination of the directorship or employment  relationship,  as
the case may be.

10.   Adjustments

     (a) In the event of a Change in  Capitalization  (as defined  below) of the
Company,  the  Committee  shall  conclusively  make  equitable  and  appropriate
adjustments,  if any,  to (i) the  maximum  number and class of shares of Common
Stock or other stock or securities  with respect to which Options may be granted
under the Plan,  (ii) the maximum  number and class of shares of Common Stock or
other stock or  securities  with respect to which  Options may be granted to any
Participant during the term of the Plan, (iii) the number and class of shares of
Common  Stock or other  stock or  securities  which are  subject to  outstanding
Options  granted under the Plan and the purchase price  therefor,  if applicable
and (iv) the number and class of shares of Common Stock or other  securities  in
respect of which Director Options are to be granted under Section 15 hereof.

     (b) If, by reason of a Change in  Capitalization,  a  Participant  shall be
entitled  to exercise an Option with  respect to new,  additional  or  different
shares of stock or securities,  such new,  additional or different  shares shall
thereupon  be subject to all of the  conditions,  restrictions  and  performance
criteria  which were  applicable  to the shares of Common  Stock  subject to the
Option prior to such Change in Capitalization.

     (c) No adjustment of the number of shares of Common Stock  available  under
the Plan or to which any Option  relates that would  otherwise be required under
this Section 10 shall be made unless and until such adjustment  either by itself
or with other  adjustments  not  previously  made  under  this  Section 10 would
require an increase or decrease of at least 1% in the number of shares of Common
Stock available under the Plan or to which any Option relates  immediately prior
to the making of such  adjustment  (the "Minimum  Adjustment").  Any  adjustment
representing a change of less than such minimum amount shall be carried  forward
and made as soon as such adjustment together with other adjustments  required by
this Section 10 and not  previously  made would result in a Minimum  Adjustment.
Notwithstanding the foregoing,  any adjustment required by this Section 10 which
otherwise would not result in a Minimum Adjustment shall be made with respect to
shares of Common Stock relating to any Option  immediately  prior to exercise of
such Option.  No fractional  shares of Common Stock or units of other securities
shall be issued  pursuant to any such  adjustment,  and any fractions  resulting
from any such adjustment  shall be eliminated in each case by rounding  downward
to the nearest whole share.

     (d)  "Change in  Capitalization"  means any  increase or  reduction  in the
number of shares of Common Stock, or any change (including,  but not limited to,
a change in value) in the shares of Common Stock or exchange of shares of Common
Stock  for a  different  number or kind of  shares  or other  securities  of the
Company   or   another   corporation,   by   reason   of   a   reclassification,
recapitalization,  merger,  consolidation,  reorganization,  spin-off, split-up,
issuance of warrants or rights or  debentures,  stock  dividend,  stock split or
reverse  stock split,  cash dividend in excess of earnings,  property  dividend,
combination  or  exchange  of shares,  change in  corporate  structure  or other
substantially similar event.

11.   Amendment and Termination of Plan

     The Board or the Committee, by resolution, may terminate,  amend, or revise
the Plan with respect to any shares as to which  Options have not been  granted.
Neither the Board nor the Committee  may,  without the consent of a Participant,
alter or  impair  any  award  previously  granted  under  the  Plan,  except  as
authorized  herein.  To the extent  necessary under applicable law, no amendment
shall be  effective  unless  approved  by the  stockholders  of the  Company  in
accordance with applicable law. Unless sooner terminated,  the Plan shall remain
in effect for a period of 10 years from the date of the Plan's  adoption  by the
Board. Termination of the Plan shall not affect any Option previously granted.

12.   Effective Date of Plan

     This Plan shall be  effective  on the date upon which it is approved by the
Board.

13.   Governing Law

     (a) Except as to matters  of  federal  law,  the Plan and the rights of all
persons claiming  hereunder shall be construed and determined in accordance with
the laws of the District of Columbia, without giving effect to conflicts of laws
principles thereof.

     (b) The  obligation  of the Company to sell or deliver the shares of Common
Stock with  respect to  Options  granted  under the Plan shall be subject to all
applicable  laws, rules and  regulations,  including all applicable  federal and
state  securities  laws, and the obtaining of all such approvals by governmental
agencies as may be deemed necessary or appropriate by the Committee.

     (c) Each  Option is subject  to the  requirement  that,  if at any time the
Committee  determines,  in its  discretion,  that the listing,  registration  or
qualification  of the shares of Common  Stock  issuable  pursuant to the Plan is
required by any  securities  exchange or under any state or federal  law, or the
consent  or  approval  of any  governmental  regulatory  body  is  necessary  or
desirable as a condition  of, or in connection  with,  the grant of an Option or
the  issuance  of the shares of Common  Stock,  no  Options  shall be granted or
payment  made  or  shares  issued,   in  whole  or  in  part,   unless  listing,
registration,  qualification,  consent or approval has been effected or obtained
free of any conditions as acceptable to the Committee.

14.   Multiple Agreements

     The terms of each Option may differ from other  Options  granted  under the
Plan at the same time, or at some other time.  The Committee may also grant more
than one Option to a given  Participant  during the term of the Plan,  either in
addition to, or in substitution for, one or more Options  previously  granted to
that individual.

15.   Director Options

     (a) Awards relating to the Common Stock  authorized under the Plan shall be
made under this section only to Directors.

     (b) Annually, on the date of the Annual Meeting of Stockholders, commencing
with the Annual Meeting in 1998, there shall be granted  automatically  (without
any action by the  Committee  or the Board) a Director  Option to each  Director
then elected to office to purchase 2,000 shares of Common Stock.

     (c) The Exercise Price for shares under each Director Option shall be equal
to 100% of the Fair  Market  Value of a share  of  Common  Stock on the date the
Director  Option is granted,  determined in accordance with Section 5(b) hereof.
The Exercise  Price of any Director  Option granted shall be paid in full at the
time of each  purchase (a) in cash and/or  (b)(i) by  delivering  to the Company
shares of the Common  Stock owned by the Director and having a Fair Market Value
on the date of exercise equal to the Exercise Price of the Director  Option,  or
(ii) by reducing the number of Shares of Common  Stock  issuable or payable upon
the exercise of a Director Option by the number of shares of Common Stock having
a Fair Market Value on the date of exercise  equal to the Exercise  Price of the
Director Option. In addition,  the Options may be exercised through a registered
broker-dealer  pursuant to such cashless  exercise  procedures (other than share
withholding)  that are,  from time to time,  deemed  acceptable.  No  fractional
shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon exercise of an Option and the number
of shares of Common Stock that may be purchased  upon exercise  shall be rounded
to the nearest number of whole shares.  Each Director Option shall be subject to
the Right of First Refusal, as set forth in Section 7.

     (d) At such times as a Director  recognizes  taxable  income in  connection
with the receipt of shares of Common Stock  hereunder (a "Taxable  Event"),  the
Director  shall pay to the  Company  the amount of taxes  required  by law to be
withheld by the Company in connection  with the Taxable Event (the  "Withholding
Taxes") prior to the issuance of such shares.  In satisfaction of the obligation
to pay the  Withholding  Taxes to the  Company,  the Director may make a written
election  (the  "Tax  Election"),  which  may be  accepted  or  rejected  in the
discretion of the Committee,  to have withheld a portion of the shares of Common
Stock then issuable to him or her having an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to
the Withholding Taxes.

     (e) An annual  Director Option grant under Section 15(b) shall become fully
vested and  exercisable at the rate of one third of the Shares  (rounded down to
the nearest whole share  number) on May 31 of each of the three years  following
the date of grant if the Director who is an optionee  under the Director  Option
continues to serve as a Director as of such date.

     (f) Each  Director  Option  shall  terminate on the date which is the fifth
anniversary  of the  date of  grant  (the  "Option  Termination  Date"),  unless
terminated earlier as follows:

          (i) If a Director's  service as a member of the Board  terminates  for
     any reason other than death or Cause (as defined  below),  the Director may
     for a period of up to two years after such  termination (but not later than
     the Option  Termination Date) exercise his or her Option to the extent, and
     only to the extent,  that such Option was vested and  exercisable as of the
     date the  Director's  service  as a member of the Board  terminated,  after
     which time the Option shall automatically terminate in full.

          (ii) If a Director's  service as a member of the Board  terminates for
     Cause,  the Option  granted to the  Director  hereunder  shall  immediately
     terminate in full and no rights  thereunder may be exercised.  For purposes
     of  this  Section  15,   "Cause"  shall  mean  (i)  fraud  or   intentional
     misrepresentation,  (ii)  embezzlement,  misappropriation  or conversion of
     assets or  opportunities  of the Company,  (iii)  conviction of a felony or
     (iv) willful engagement by the Director in activities contrary to the bests
     interests of the Company.

          (iii) If a  Director  dies  while a member  of the  Board or within 24
     months  after  termination  of service as a Director as described in clause
     (i) of this  Section  15(f),  the  Option  granted to the  Director  may be
     exercised at any time within twelve (12) months after the Director's  death
     (but not later than the Option  Termination  Date) by the person or persons
     to whom such rights under the Option shall pass by will,  or by the laws of
     descent or  distribution,  after which time the Option  shall  terminate in
     full; provided, however, that an Option may be exercised to the extent, and
     only to the extent, that the Option was exercisable on the date of death or
     earlier termination of the Director's service as a member of the Board; and
     provided,  further,  that any unvested Option or Options shall  immediately
     vest upon the death of a Director while a member of the Board.

     (g) If there  shall  occur any  event  described  in  Section  10,  then in
addition  to  the  matters  contemplated  thereby,  the  Director  Options  then
outstanding  and  future  grants  thereof  shall be  automatically  adjusted  as
contemplated by Section 10.

     (h) The  provisions  of  Sections  1, 2, 3,  7, 8,  10,  11,  12 and 13 are
incorporated  herein by this reference.  Unless the context otherwise  requires,
the provisions of this Section 15 shall be construed as a separate plan.

                                  CERTIFICATION

I, Henry D. Edelman, certify that:

1.   I have  reviewed  this  quarterly  report  on  Form  10-Q  of  the  Federal
     Agricultural Mortgage Corporation;
2.   Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of
     a material  fact or omit to state a  material  fact  necessary  to make the
     statements made, in light of the circumstances  under which such statements
     were made,  not  misleading  with  respect  to the  period  covered by this
     report;
3.   Based on my  knowledge,  the  financial  statements,  and  other  financial
     information  included  in  this  report,  fairly  present  in all  material
     respects the financial  condition,  results of operations and cash flows of
     the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;
4.   The  registrant's  other  certifying  officer  and  I are  responsible  for
     establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
     in Exchange Act Rules  13a-15(e) and  15d-15(e))  for the registrant and we
     have:
          a)   designed such disclosure controls and procedures,  or caused such
               disclosure  controls  and  procedures  to be  designed  under our

               fiscal  quarter  in  the  case  of an  annual  report)  that  has
               materially  affected,  or  is  reasonably  likely  to  materially

               design or operation of internal control over financial  reporting

               ability  to  record,  process,  summarize  and  report  financial
               information; and
          b)   any fraud,  whether or not material,  that involves management or
