Note 1.  Accounting Policies

        (a)   Cash and Cash Equivalents

     Farmer Mac considers  highly liquid  investment  securities  with remaining
maturities  of  three  months  or  less  at the  time  of  purchase  to be  cash
equivalents. Changes in the balance of cash and cash equivalents are reported in
the Condensed  Consolidated  Statements of Cash Flows.  The following table sets
forth information  regarding certain cash and non-cash  transactions for the six
months ended June 30, 2003 and 2002.

        (b)   Loans

     As of June 30, 2003,  loans held by Farmer Mac included  $51.8 million held
for sale and $953.6 million held for investment.  As of December 31, 2002, loans
held by Farmer Mac included  $37.0 million held for sale and $929.1 million held
for investment.  Detailed information regarding the allowance for loan losses is
presented in Note 1(c).

        (c) Allowance for Losses

     As of June 30, 2003,  Farmer Mac  maintained a $21.9 million  allowance for
losses to cover estimated  probable losses on loans held, real estate owned, and
loans  underlying   Long-Term  Standby  Purchase   Commitments   ("LTSPCs")  and
securities  guaranteed  by Farmer Mac under the  Farmer Mac I program  after the
1996  revision  to  its  charter   ("Post-1996   Act  Farmer  Mac  I  Guaranteed
Securities").  (See  Note 2 for a  description  of  LTSPCs.)  The  allowance  is
increased  through periodic  provisions for loan losses that are charged against
net  interest  income and  provisions  for losses that are charged to  operating
expense and is reduced by charge-offs for actual losses, net of recoveries.

     Farmer Mac's allowance for losses is estimated  using a systematic  process
that begins with management's  evaluation of the results of its proprietary loan
pool  simulation  and  guarantee fee model (the  "Model");  those results may be
modified by the  application  of  management's  judgment that takes into account
factors  including:

          o    economic conditions;
          o    geographic and agricultural  commodity  concentrations  in Farmer
               Mac's portfolio;
          o    the credit profile of Farmer Mac's portfolio;
          o    delinquency trends of Farmer Mac's portfolio;
          o    Farmer Mac's experience in the management and sale of real estate
               owned; and
          o    historical  charge-off  and recovery  activities  of Farmer Mac's
               portfolio.

     The Model offers historical loss experience on agricultural  mortgage loans
similar to those on which Farmer Mac has assumed  credit risk, but over a longer
period of time than Farmer Mac's own experience to date. Farmer Mac's systematic
methodology for determining its allowance for losses is expected to migrate over
time,  away from the Model and  toward  the  increased  use of Farmer  Mac's own
historical  portfolio loss experience,  as that experience continues to develop.
During this  migration,  Farmer Mac will  continue  to use the results  from the
Model,  augmented by the  application  of  management's  judgment (as  described
above), to determine its loan loss allowance.

     Management  believes that its use of this  methodology  produces a reliable
estimate of total probable  losses,  as of the balance sheet date, for all loans
included in Farmer Mac's portfolio,  including loans held, real estate owned and
loans underlying Post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs.

     The table below  summarizes the three  components of Farmer Mac's allowance
for losses as of June 30, 2003 and December 31, 2002.

                                                             ----------------   -----------------
</TABLE>
     Farmer Mac's total provision for losses was $2.1 million for second quarter
2003,  compared to $2.0 million for second  quarter 2002.  During second quarter
2003,  Farmer Mac charged off $1.3 million in losses  against the  allowance for
losses and had no recoveries. During second quarter 2002, Farmer Mac charged off
$0.9  million in losses  against the  allowance  for losses and  recovered  $0.2
million from previously charged off losses, for net charge-offs of $0.7 million.
The net  charge-offs  for second  quarter  2003 and 2002  included  $17,000  and
$225,000,  respectively,  related to previously  accrued or advanced interest on
loans and Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities.

     No  allowance  for losses has been made for loans  underlying  Farmer Mac I
Guaranteed  Securities issued prior to the Farm Credit System Reform Act of 1996
(the "1996 Act") or securities  issued under the Farmer Mac II program  ("Farmer
Mac II Guaranteed Securities").  Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities issued prior
to the 1996 Act are supported by unguaranteed first loss subordinated interests,
which are expected to exceed the  estimated  credit  losses on those loans.  The
guaranteed portions of loans collateralizing Farmer Mac II Guaranteed Securities
are  guaranteed by the United States  Department of Agriculture  ("USDA").  Each
USDA  guarantee  is an  obligation  backed by the full  faith and  credit of the
United States. To date, Farmer Mac has experienced no losses on any pre-1996 Act
Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities or on any Farmer Mac II Guaranteed Securities
and does not expect to incur any such losses in the future.

        (d) Financial Derivatives

     Farmer Mac enters into  financial  derivative  transactions  principally to
protect against risk from the effects of market price or interest rate movements
on the value of certain assets and future cash flows or debt  issuance,  not for
trading or  speculative  purposes.  Farmer Mac enters  into  interest  rate swap
contracts  principally to adjust the  characteristics  of its short-term debt to
match more closely the cash flow and duration characteristics of its longer-term
mortgage  and  other  assets,  and also to  adjust  the  characteristics  of its
long-term debt to match more closely the cash flow and duration  characteristics
of  its  short-term   assets,   thereby  reducing   interest  rate  risk.  These
transactions  also may provide an overall lower effective cost of borrowing than
would otherwise be available in the conventional debt market.

     All financial  derivatives  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value
as  a  freestanding  asset  or  liability.   Financial  derivatives  in  hedging
relationships  that mitigate exposure to changes in the fair value of assets are
considered  fair value hedges.  Financial  derivatives in hedging  relationships
that mitigate the exposure to the  variability in expected  future cash flows or
other  forecasted  transactions  are  considered  cash  flow  hedges.  Financial
derivatives  that do not satisfy the hedging  criteria of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative  Instruments and Hedging
Activities  as amended  ("SFAS 133") are not accounted for as hedges and changes
in the fair  values of those  financial  derivatives  are  reported in income or
expense.

     The net after-tax increase to earnings under SFAS 133 during second quarter
2003 totaled $2.6 million, and the net after-tax decrease to other comprehensive
income totaled $6.5 million. Substantially all of the increase in earnings under
SFAS 133 resulted  from  increases in the fair values of callable  interest rate
contracts.  Substantially  all of the  decrease  to other  comprehensive  income
represented changes in the fair values of forward sale contracts,  interest rate
swap contracts and settled forward sale contracts.  As of June 30, 2003,  Farmer
Mac had approximately  $68.1 million of net after-tax  unrealized losses on cash
flow hedges included in accumulated other  comprehensive  income.  These amounts
will be  reclassified  into earnings in the same period or periods  during which
the hedged  forecasted  transactions  (either  the  payment of  interest  or the
issuance of discount  notes)  affect  earnings  or  immediately  when it becomes
probable that the original hedged  forecasted  transaction will not occur within
two months of the originally specified date. Over the next twelve months, Farmer
Mac estimates that $1.2 million of the amount currently  reported in accumulated
other  comprehensive  income (loss) will be reclassified into earnings.  For the
quarter  ended  June 30,  2003,  any  ineffectiveness  related  to Farmer  Mac's
designated hedges was insignificant.

     SFAS 133 also required, as the change in the fair value of a hedged item, a
$0.1  million  decrease in the line item "loans" on the  condensed  consolidated
balance sheet for second  quarter 2003.  For second  quarter 2002,  the recorded
change  in the fair  value  of a hedged  item  was a $0.2  million  decrease  in
"loans."

        (e)   Earnings Per Common Share

     Basic earnings per common share are based on the weighted-average number of
common shares  outstanding.  Diluted  earnings per common share are based on the
weighted-average  number of common  shares  outstanding  adjusted to include all
potentially  dilutive common stock options.  The following  schedule  reconciles
basic and diluted  earnings per common share for the three months ended June 30,
2003 and 2002:

        (f)   Preferred Stock

     On May 6, 2002, the Corporation  issued 700,000 shares of 6.40%  Cumulative
Preferred Stock,  Series A ("Series A Preferred Stock"),  which has a redemption
price and  liquidation  preference of $50.00 per share,  plus accrued and unpaid
dividends,  if any. The Series A Preferred  Stock does not have a maturity date.
Beginning  on June 30,  2012,  Farmer  Mac has the option to redeem the Series A
Preferred  Stock at any time,  in whole or in part, at the  redemption  price of
$50.00 per share,  plus accrued and unpaid  dividends  through and including the
redemption date, if any. Farmer Mac will pay cumulative  dividends on the Series
A Preferred  Stock  quarterly  in arrears,  when and if declared by its Board of
Directors.  The costs of issuing  the Series A Preferred  Stock were  charged to
additional paid-in capital.

     On June 5, 2003,  Farmer  Mac's Board of  Directors  declared a dividend of
$0.80 per share on the Series A  Preferred  Stock for the  period  from April 1,
2003 to June 30, 2003. The aggregate  amount of dividend of $560,000 was paid on
June 30, 2003.

            (g) Stock-Based Compensation

     Farmer Mac accounts for its stock-based  employee  compensation plans using
the intrinsic value method of accounting for employee stock options  pursuant to
Accounting  Principles  Board  Opinion No. 25,  Accounting  for Stock  Issued to
Employees,  and has adopted  the  disclosure-only  provisions  of  Statement  of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based  Compensation
("SFAS 123"), as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation--Transition and Disclosure ("SFAS 148").
Accordingly,  no  compensation  expense was recognized in second quarter 2003 or
second quarter 2002 for employee  stock  options.  Had Farmer Mac elected to use
the fair value method of  accounting  for  employee  stock  options,  net income
available  to common  stockholders  and earnings per share for the three and six
months  ended June 30,  2003 and 2002  would have been  reduced to the pro forma
amounts indicated in the following table:

            (h) Reclassifications

     Certain  reclassifications of prior period information were made to conform
to the current period presentation.

            (i) New Accounting Standards

     On January 1, 2003,  Farmer Mac adopted  Statement of Financial  Accounting
Standards No. 145,  Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of
FASB  Statement No. 13 and Technical  Corrections  ("SFAS 145"),  which requires
gains and losses from the  extinguishment or repurchase of debt to be classified
as extraordinary items only if they meet the criteria for such classification in
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30, Reporting the Results of Operations,
Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business and  Extraordinary,
Unusual and Infrequently  Occurring Events and Transactions ("APB 30"). Prior to
the  adoption  of this  standard,  gains and losses from the  extinguishment  or
repurchase  of debt  were  classified  as  extraordinary  items.  This  standard
effectively  eliminates  the  classification  of most  debt  extinguishments  or
repurchases  as  extraordinary  items,  as reflected  in Farmer Mac's  condensed
consolidated  financial  statements as of and for the three and six months ended
June 30, 2003. Farmer Mac's condensed  consolidated  financial  statements as of
and  for  the  three  and  six  months  ended  June  30,  2002   reflected  debt
extinguishments or repurchases as extraordinary items.

     On January 1, 2003, Farmer Mac adopted the liability recognition provisions
of the Financial  Accounting  Standards Board Interpretation No. 45, Guarantor's
Accounting  and  Disclosure  Requirements  for  Guarantees,  Including  Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others ("FIN 45"). These provisions require Farmer
Mac to  recognize,  at the  inception of a guarantee,  a liability  for the fair
value of its  obligation  to stand  ready to  perform  under  the  terms of each
guarantee  agreement  and an asset  that is equal to the fair  value of the fees
that will be received over the life of each  guarantee.  Subsequently,  both the
asset and the  liability  are measured  and recorded at their fair value.  These
provisions  have  been  applied  on  a  prospective   basis  to  guarantees  and
commitments that were issued or modified on or after January 1, 2003. See Note 2
for additional  information on Farmer Mac's guarantee obligations and LTSPCs and
the manner in which the  obligations  to "stand  ready" have been  reflected  in
Farmer Mac's condensed consolidated financial statements.

     In April 2003, the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board ("FASB")  issued
Statement of Financial  Accounting Standards No. 149, Amendment of Statement 133
on  Derivative  Instruments  and Hedging  Activities  ("SFAS  149"),  which will
require Farmer Mac to account for  commitments to purchase or sell mortgages and
Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities  entered into after June 30, 2003 as financial
derivatives.  Farmer Mac expects these financial  derivatives to qualify as cash
flow  hedges of  forecasted  transactions.  Therefore,  Farmer  Mac will  record
commitments to purchase or sell mortgages or Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities at
fair value as assets or  liabilities  and the change in the fair  values will be
recorded  as  a  corresponding   increase  or  decrease  in  accumulated   other
comprehensive  income. Farmer Mac does note anticipate that SFAS 149 will have a
material effect on its net income.

Note 2.  Off-Balance Sheet Guarantees and Long-Term Standby Purchase Commitments

Overview

     Farmer Mac offers  approved  agricultural  and rural  residential  mortgage
lenders two  off-balance  sheet  alternatives  to increase  their  liquidity  or
lending  capacity  while  retaining the cash flow  benefits of their loans:  (1)
Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities,  which are available through either the Farmer
Mac I program or the Farmer Mac II program,  and (2) LTSPCs, which are available
only through the Farmer Mac I program.

     To be eligible for the Farmer Mac I program,  a loan must meet Farmer Mac's
credit underwriting,  appraisal and documentation standards. Accordingly, Farmer
Mac  believes  the credit risk it assumes for Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities
backed by loans that are eligible for the Farmer Mac I program and for LTSPCs is
the same.

     For all guarantees and commitments that were executed on or before December
31, 2002,  Farmer Mac's policy for the  recognition  of guarantee fees on Farmer
Mac Guaranteed  Securities and commitment fees on LTSPCs is to recognize them on
an accrual basis over the life of the underlying  loans.  Because these fees are
paid in arrears, no guarantee fees or commitment fees are unearned at the end of
any reporting  period.  If Farmer Mac purchases a delinquent  loan  underlying a
Farmer  Mac  Guaranteed  Security  or an LTSPC,  Farmer Mac stops  accruing  the
guarantee or  commitment  fee upon the purchase of the loan. If the loan becomes
current and is  repurchased  by the seller under the terms of the LTSPC,  Farmer
Mac resumes accrual of the fee.

     Pursuant to FIN 45, for all guarantees and  commitments  issued or modified
on or after January 1, 2003, Farmer Mac recognizes an asset that is equal to the
fair value of the fees that will be received over the life of each  guarantee or
commitment  and a liability for the fair value of its  obligation to stand ready
to perform under the guarantee or  commitment.  Both the asset and the liability
are  subsequently  measured  and  recorded  at their fair value in Farmer  Mac's
condensed consolidated financial statements.

Off-Balance Sheet Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities

     The process for creating off-balance sheet Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities
involves the transfer of  agricultural  mortgage loans into trusts that are used
as vehicles for the  securitization of the transferred assets and the beneficial
interests  in the  trusts  are sold to  third  party  investors  as  Farmer  Mac
Guaranteed Securities. Farmer Mac guarantees the timely payment of principal and
interest on the  certificates  issued by the trusts,  regardless  of whether the
trusts actually receive scheduled  payments on the related  underlying loans. As
consideration  for Farmer Mac's  assumption of the credit risk on these mortgage
pass-through  certificates,  Farmer Mac receives a guarantee fee. These fees are
collected as installment  payments are made on the underlying loans, until those
loans have been  repaid,  repurchased  from the  related  trusts,  or  otherwise
liquidated (generally as a result of default). The aggregate amount of guarantee
fees  received on Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities  depends upon the amount of
such securities outstanding and on the guarantee fee rate.


     Farmer Mac is required to make the timely payment of principal and interest
on Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities if the borrowers on the underlying loans or
USDA-guaranteed portions do not make their scheduled installment payments.

     o    Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities.  When a loan  underlying a Farmer
          Mac I Guaranteed Security becomes 90 days or more past due, Farmer Mac
          has the  option to  repurchase  the loan from the trust and  generally
          does repurchase such loans,  thereby reducing the principal balance of
          the  outstanding  Farmer  Mac  Guaranteed  Security.   If  Farmer  Mac
          exercises  its  option to  purchase  a loan that is  collateral  for a
          Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Security,  Farmer Mac would have the right to
          enforce  the terms of the loan and,  in the event of a default,  would
          have the right to foreclose upon the  collateral  underlying the loan.
          Farmer Mac typically  recovers a  significant  portion of the value of
          defaulted  loans  purchased  either through  borrower  payments,  loan
          payoffs,  payments  by third  parties or  foreclosure  and sale of the
          collateral.

     o    Farmer Mac II  Guaranteed  Securities.  Farmer Mac has recourse to the
          USDA for amounts  advanced  for the timely  payment of  principal  and
          interest on Farmer Mac II Guaranteed Securities.  That recourse is the
          USDA  guarantee,  a full  faith and  credit  obligation  of the United
          States that becomes  enforceable  if a lender fails to repurchase  the
          USDA-guaranteed  portion from its owner  within 30 days after  written
          demand from the owner when (a) the borrower under the guaranteed  loan
          is in default not less than 60 days in the payment of any principal or
          interest  due on the  USDA-guaranteed  portion,  or (b) the lender has
          failed to remit to the owner the payment  made by the  borrower on the
          USDA-guaranteed  portion or any related  loan  subsidy  within 30 days
          after the lender's receipt of the payment.

     The  following  table  presents the maximum  principal  amount of potential
undiscounted  future  payments  that  Farmer Mac could be required to make under
off-balance  sheet  Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities  as of June 30,  2003 and
December 31, 2002, not including  offsets  provided by any recourse  provisions,
recoveries from third parties or collateral for the underlying loans.

     As of June 30, 2003, the  weighted-average  remaining maturity of all loans
underlying  off-balance  sheet Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities was 15.3 years.
For the off-balance sheet Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities that were executed
on or before  December  31,  2002,  Farmer Mac has  recorded  an  allowance  for
probable losses that was $1.3 million as of June 30, 2003 and $1.3 million as of
December 31, 2002. For those securities that were issued or modified on or after
January 1, 2003,  Farmer Mac has  recorded the fair value of its  obligation  to
stand  ready under the  guarantee  as a  liability.  As of June 30,  2003,  this
liability approximated $0.3 million and was included in other liabilities on the
condensed consolidated balance sheet.

Long-Term Standby Purchase Commitments (LTSPCs)

     An LTSPC is a commitment by Farmer Mac to purchase eligible loans on one or
more undetermined  future dates. In consideration for Farmer Mac's assumption of
the credit  risk on loans  underlying  an LTSPC,  Farmer Mac  receives an annual
commitment fee on the outstanding balance of those loans in monthly installments
based on the outstanding balance of those loans.

     An LTSPC permits a seller to nominate from its portfolio a segregated  pool
of loans,  which are  retained in the  seller's  portfolio  and  serviced by the
seller.  Upon  nomination,  Farmer Mac reviews the loan pool to confirm  that it
conforms to Farmer Mac's underwriting standards. Upon Farmer Mac's acceptance of
the conforming loans, the seller effectively  transfers the credit risk on those
loans to Farmer Mac,  thereby  reducing  the seller's  credit and  concentration
exposures and,  consequently,  its regulatory capital requirements and loan loss
reserve requirements. Credit risk is transferred through Farmer Mac's commitment
to purchase the segregated loans from the  counterparty  based upon Farmer Mac's
original credit review and acceptance of the credit risk on the loans.

     The  specific  events or  circumstances  that would  require  Farmer Mac to
purchase some or all of the segregated  loans under its LTSPCs include:  (1) the
failure of the borrower under any loan to make  installment  payments under that
loan for a period of four months;  or (2) the determination by the holder of the
LTSPC to sell some or all of the loans under the LTSPC to Farmer Mac.

      An LTSPC commits Farmer Mac to purchase these loans:

          o    at par, if the loans become four months delinquent,  with accrued
               and unpaid  interest  payable out of any future loan  payments or
               liquidation proceeds received;
          o    at a  mark-to-market  price,  if the loans are not delinquent and
               are standard Farmer Mac loan products;
          o    at a mark-to-market negotiated price for all (but not some) loans
               in the pool, if they are not four months delinquent; or
          o    in exchange for Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities.

The  mark-to-market  price  would be  based on  either  the sale of  Farmer  Mac
Guaranteed  Securities in the capital markets or the funding  obtained by Farmer
Mac through the issuance of debt in the capital markets.

     As of June 30, 2003 and December 31, 2002, the maximum  principal amount of
potential  undiscounted  future  payments  that Farmer Mac could be requested to
make under LTSPCs,  not including  offsets provided by any recourse  provisions,
recoveries from third parties or collateral for the underlying  loans,  was $2.8
billion and $2.7 billion, respectively.

     Farmer Mac believes that the credit risk assumed in LTSPC  transactions  is
the same as the credit risk  assumed on  Post-1996  Act Farmer Mac I  Guaranteed
Securities.  In the event of loan  default,  Farmer  Mac would have the right to
enforce  the  terms of the  loans  including  the  right to  foreclose  upon the
collateral  underlying  such loans.  Farmer Mac believes that it will  generally
recover a  significant  portion of the value of the  defaulted  loans  purchased
either through  borrower  payments,  loan payoffs,  payments by third parties or
foreclosure and sale of the collateral. To date, Farmer Mac has not incurred any
charge-offs on loans underlying LTSPCs.

     As of June 30, 2003, the  weighted-average  remaining maturity of all loans
underlying LTSPCs was 15.4 years. For the LTSPCs that were executed on or before
December 31, 2002, Farmer Mac has recorded an allowance for probable losses that
was $13.0 million as of June 30, 2003 and $11.4 million as of December 31, 2002.
For those  LTSPCs  that were  issued or  modified  on or after  January 1, 2003,
Farmer Mac has  recorded the fair value of its  obligation  to stand ready under
the commitment as a liability.  As of June 30, 2003, this liability approximated
$3.6 million and was included in other liabilities on the condensed consolidated
balance sheet.

Note 3.  Comprehensive Income

     Comprehensive  income is  comprised  of net income  plus  other  changes in
stockholders'  equity not resulting  from  investments  by or  distributions  to
stockholders.  The following table sets forth comprehensive income for the three
and six months ended June 30, 2003 and 2002. The changes in unrealized  gains on
securities  available-for-sale  are net of the  related  deferred  taxes of $4.7
million  and $3.0  million  for the three and six months  ended  June 30,  2003,
respectively,  and $10.7  million and $6.3  million for the three and six months
ended  June  30,  2002,  respectively.  The  changes  in the  fair  value of the
financial  derivatives  classified  as cash  flow  hedges  for the three and six
months  ended June 20, 2003 are net of deferred  taxes of $3.5  million and $2.9
million,  respectively,  and $7.9 million and $6.1 million for the three and six
months ended June 30, 2002, respectively.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and  Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
        of Operations


Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

     Certain  statements  made in this report are  "forward-looking  statements"
within  the  meaning of the  Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform Act of 1995
pertaining  to  management's  current  expectations  as to Farmer  Mac's  future
financial results, business prospects and business developments. Forward-looking
statements  include,  without  limitation,   any  statement  that  may  predict,
forecast,  indicate or imply future results,  performance or  achievements,  and
typically are accompanied by, and identified with, such terms as  "anticipates,"
"believes,"  "expects,"  "intends," "should" and similar phrases.  The following
management's  discussion  and  analysis  includes   forward-looking   statements
addressing  Farmer Mac's  prospects  for  earnings and growth in loan  purchase,
guarantee,  LTSPC and securitization  volume;  trends in net interest income and
provision  for  losses;  changes in capital  position;  and other  business  and
financial matters.

     Management's  expectations  for Farmer Mac's future  necessarily  involve a
number of assumptions,  estimates and the evaluation of risks and uncertainties.
Various  factors  could cause Farmer  Mac's  actual  results or events to differ
materially from the expectations as expressed or implied by the  forward-looking
statements, including uncertainties regarding:

     o    the rate and  direction of  development  of the  secondary  market for
          agricultural mortgage loans;
     o    the possible  establishment  of  additional  statutory  or  regulatory
          restrictions  on Farmer Mac that could  hamper its growth or  restrain
          its profitability;
     o    legislative or regulatory  developments or  interpretations  of Farmer
          Mac's statutory  charter that could adversely affect Farmer Mac or the
          ability of certain lenders to participate in its programs or the terms
          of any such participation;
     o    possible  reaction in the financial  markets to events  involving GSEs
          other than Farmer Mac;
     o    Farmer Mac's access to the debt markets at favorable rates and terms;
     o    the  possible  effect of the  risk-based  capital  requirement,  which
          could,  under  certain  circumstances,  be in excess of the  statutory
          minimum capital level;
     o    the  outcome of the pending  review of Farmer Mac by the U.S.  General
          Accounting Office (the "GAO");
     o    the rate of growth in agricultural mortgage indebtedness;
     o    lender  interest  in Farmer  Mac  credit  products  and the Farmer Mac
          secondary market;
     o    borrower    preferences   for   fixed-rate    agricultural    mortgage
          indebtedness;
     o    competition in the  origination or purchase of  agricultural  mortgage
          loans  and  the  sale  of   agricultural   mortgage-backed   and  debt
          securities;
     o    substantial  changes in  interest  rates,  agricultural  land  values,
          commodity prices, export demand for U.S. agricultural products and the
          general economy;
     o    protracted  adverse  weather,  market  or other  conditions  affecting
          particular  geographic  regions or particular  commodities  related to
          agricultural mortgage loans backing Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities
          or under LTSPCs; or
     o    the  effects on the  agricultural  economy  of any  changes in federal
          assistance for agriculture.

     The foregoing factors are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report may
include additional factors that could adversely affect Farmer Mac's business and
its financial  performance.  Furthermore,  new risk factors  emerge from time to
time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor
assess the  effects of such  factors on Farmer  Mac's  business or the extent to
which any factor, or combination of factors,  may cause actual results to differ
materially  from the  expectations  expressed or implied by the  forward-looking
statements.  In light of  these  potential  risks  and  uncertainties,  no undue
reliance should be placed on any  forward-looking  statements  expressed in this
report. Furthermore, Farmer Mac undertakes no obligation to release publicly the
results  of  revisions  to any  forward-looking  statements  that may be made to
reflect any future events or circumstances  except as otherwise  mandated by the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

      The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires the
use of estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the
consolidated financial statements and related notes for the periods presented.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. The critical accounting policy
that is both important to the portrayal of Farmer Mac's financial condition and
results of operations and requires complex, subjective judgments is the
accounting policy for the allowance for losses. Farmer Mac's allowance for
losses is presented in three components on its consolidated balance sheet:

     o    an "Allowance for loan losses" on loans held for investment;
     o    a valuation  allowance on real estate owned,  which is included in the
          balance sheet under "Real estate owned,  net of valuation  allowance";
          and
     o    an allowance for losses on loans underlying Post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I
          Guaranteed  Securities  and  LTSPCs,  which is included in the balance
          sheet under "Reserve for losses."

     The purpose of the allowance for losses is to provide for estimated  losses
that are  probable to have  occurred as of the  balance  sheet date,  and not to
predict or  account  for  future  potential  losses.  The  determination  of the
allowance for losses requires management to make significant  estimates based on
information  available as of the balance  sheet date,  including the amounts and
timing of losses and current market and economic conditions. These estimates are
subject to change in future reporting periods if such conditions and information
change.  For  example,  a  continued  decline in the  national  or  agricultural
economies could result in an increase in delinquencies  or  foreclosures,  which
may require additional allowances for losses in future periods.

      Farmer Mac maintains an allowance for losses to cover estimated probable
losses on its loans held, real estate owned and loans underlying Post-1996 Act
Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs. In estimating probable losses,
management considers the results of its proprietary loan pool simulation and
guarantee fee model. Those results may be modified by the application of
management's judgment that takes into account factors such as:

     o    economic conditions;
     o    geographic and agricultural  commodity  concentrations in Farmer Mac's
          portfolio;
     o    the credit profile of Farmer Mac's portfolio;
     o    delinquency trends of Farmer Mac's portfolio;
     o    Farmer  Mac's  experience  in the  management  and sale of real estate
          owned; and
     o    historical   charge-off  and  recovery   activities  of  Farmer  Mac's
          portfolio.

The allowance is increased through periodic  provisions for loan losses that are
charged  against net interest  income and provisions for losses that are charged
to  operating  expense  and reduced by  charge-offs  for actual  losses,  net of
recoveries.

     No  allowance  for losses has been made for loans  underlying  Farmer Mac I
Guaranteed  Securities  issued prior to the 1996 Act or Farmer Mac II Guaranteed
Securities.  Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities issued prior to the 1996 Act are
supported by unguaranteed first loss subordinated interests,  which are expected
to exceed the estimated credit losses on those loans.  USDA-guaranteed  portions
collateralizing  Farmer Mac II Guaranteed  Securities are obligations  backed by
the full  faith  and  credit  of the  United  States.  To date,  Farmer  Mac has
experienced no losses on any pre-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities or
on any Farmer Mac II Guaranteed Securities and does not expect to incur any such
losses in the future.

     Further  information  regarding  the  allowance  for losses is  included in
"--Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Management--Credit
Risk."

Results of Operations

     Overview.  Net income  available to common  stockholders for second quarter
2003,  was $8.4  million or $0.70 per  diluted  common  share,  compared to $6.3
million or $0.52 per diluted common share for second quarter 2002.

      Farmer Mac's revenue growth continued in second quarter 2003, reflecting
the effects of outstanding guarantee and commitment volume as of June 30, 2003
that was more than $420 million higher than at the close of second quarter 2002
and increased net interest income. During second quarter 2003, Farmer Mac:

     o    added $179.0 million of Farmer Mac I eligible loans under LTSPCs;
     o    purchased  $65.6  million  of newly  originated  Farmer Mac I eligible
          loans; and
     o    purchased $77.6 million of Farmer Mac II guaranteed  portions of loans
          guaranteed by USDA.

     USDA is currently forecasting net cash income on farms for 2003 to be $55.1
billion,  up 26  percent  from  2002  forecasted  levels of $43.8  billion.  The
forecasted  net cash income on farms for 2003  includes  government  payments of
$21.4 billion, as compared to $11.8 billion in 2002, and increases in total crop
and  livestock  receipts.  USDA  forecasts  farm real  estate  values to rise by
approximately  3.0 percent in 2003. This forecast is up from 1.5 percent earlier
this year,  but still  slightly less than farm real estate growth of 4.0 percent
in 2002,  5.2 percent in 2001,  and 6.8 percent in 2000.  On average,  farm real
estate  values grew nearly 4.0 percent  annually  during the 1990s.  Regionally,
farm real  estate  values may vary with  differing  rates of  increase,  or even
decrease,  depending on  differences  in land quality and location,  commodities
grown,  credit conditions,  non-farm investment  opportunities,  government farm
policies, and production risks and weather uncertainties unique to each region's
agriculture.

     Set forth below is a more  detailed  discussion  of Farmer Mac's results of
operations.

     Net  Interest  Income.  Net  interest  income was $9.2  million  for second
quarter 2003 and $18.6 million year-to-date,  compared to $8.9 million and $16.3
million,  respectively,  for the same periods in 2002.  The net interest  yield,
which does not include guarantee fees for loans purchased prior to April 1, 2001
(the  effective  date of Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 140,
Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial  Assets and  Extinguishments
of  Liabilities  ("SFAS  140")),  was 92 basis  points  for  year-to-date  2003,
compared to 91 basis points for  year-to-date  2002. The net interest yields for
year-to-date   2003  and  year-to-date  2002  included  the  benefits  of  yield
maintenance   payments   received  of  12  basis  points  and  7  basis  points,
respectively. Yield maintenance payments represent the present value of expected
future interest income streams and accelerate the recognition of interest income
from the  related  loans.  Because  the timing and size of these  payments  vary
greatly,  variations should not be considered indicative of positive or negative
trends to gauge future financial results. The effect of the adoption of SFAS 140
was a  reclassification  of  approximately  $2.2  million  (11 basis  points) of
guarantee fee income as interest income for year-to-date 2003,  compared to $0.7
million (4 basis points) for year-to-date 2002.

     The following table provides information regarding the average balances and
rates of  interest-earning  assets and funding for the six months ended June 30,
2003 and 2002.  The  balance of  non-accruing  loans is  included in the average
balance  of  interest  earning  loans  presented,  though no  related  income is
included in the income figures presented. The decreases in the average rates for
cash and cash equivalents  reflect their short-term nature. The decreases in the
average rates for  investments  and loans and Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities
reflect the  relatively  large  proportion  of  adjustable  rates in those asset
categories (76.1 percent of investments and 63.9 percent of loans and Farmer Mac
Guaranteed Securities). The decrease in the average rate for discount notes also
reflects their short-term  nature. The decreases in all of these rates track the
general decrease in market rates between the two periods.

</TABLE>


     Guarantee and  Commitment  Fees.  Guarantee and  commitment  fees were $5.1
million for second  quarter  2003,  compared to $4.7 million for second  quarter
2002. The increase in guarantee and commitment  fees reflects an increase in the
average balance of outstanding  guarantees and LTSPCs.  Excluding the effects of
the  adoption  of SFAS 140 that  reclassified  $1.1  million  and $0.7  million,
respectively, of guarantee fee income as interest income for second quarter 2003
and second quarter 2002,  guarantee and commitment  fees for second quarter 2003
and  second  quarter  2002  would  have  been  $6.2  million  and $5.4  million,
respectively.  The difference or "spread"  between the cost of Farmer Mac's debt
funding for loans and Post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities  held on
its books  and the  yield on those  assets is  composed  of one  component  that
compensates  for credit risk,  which would continue to be received by Farmer Mac
as a  guarantee  fee if  the  assets  were  sold,  and  another  component  that
compensates  for interest rate risk,  which would not  typically  continue to be
received  by Farmer  Mac  (except  to the extent  attributable  to any  retained
interest-only strip) if the asset were sold.

     Miscellaneous income decreased to $0.1 million for second quarter 2003 from
$0.4 million for second quarter 2002 due to a reduction in late fees received.

     Expenses.  Compensation and employee  benefits for second quarter 2003 were
$1.5  million,  compared to $1.3 million for second  quarter  2002.  General and
administrative  expenses for second quarter 2003 were $1.2 million,  compared to
$1.5 million for second quarter 2002. Regulatory fees assessed by FCA for second
quarter  2003 were $0.4  million,  compared to $0.2  million for second  quarter
2002.

     Farmer Mac's provision for losses was $0.7 million for second quarter 2003,
compared to $2.0  million for second  quarter  2002.  (See  "--Quantitative  and
Qualitative   Disclosures  About  Market  Risk   Management--Credit   Risk"  for
additional information regarding Farmer Mac's provision for losses and provision
for loan losses.) As of June 30, 2003,  Farmer Mac's total  allowance for losses
totaled  $21.9  million,  or 0.45  percent  of  outstanding  loans held or loans
underlying Post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs, compared
to $20.0  million (0.42 percent of  outstanding  loans held or loans  underlying
Post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities and LTSPCs) as of December 31,
2002.

     Gain on the  Repurchase  of Debt.  For  second  quarter  2002,  Farmer  Mac
recognized  a gain of  $0.9  million  on the  repurchase  of  $18.9  million  of
outstanding  Farmer Mac debt that had a maturity date of October 14, 2011 and an
annual  interest  rate of 5.4  percent.  Prior  to the  adoption  of SFAS 145 on
January 1, 2003, this gain was presented as a net after-tax  extraordinary  gain
of $0.6 million. These debt securities were replaced with new fixed-rate funding
to the same maturity dates at more attractive  interest  rates,  which preserves
Farmer Mac's  asset-liability  match and reduces future interest expense.  There
were no gains or losses on the repurchase of debt during second quarter 2003.

     Gains on Financial Derivatives and Trading Assets. For second quarter 2003,
the gain on financial  derivatives and trading assets resulting from the effects
of SFAS 133 was $3.9  million,  compared  to a loss of $0.2  million  for second
quarter 2002. The gain in second quarter 2003 resulted  primarily from increases
in the fair values of callable interest rate contracts.

     Non-GAAP Performance Measures.  Farmer Mac reports its financial results in
accordance with GAAP. In addition to GAAP measures,  Farmer Mac presents certain
non-GAAP performance  measures.  These non-GAAP performance measures are used by
Farmer Mac to develop financial plans, to measure corporate performance,  and to
set incentive compensation. As described below, because FASB has adopted a mixed
attribute  accounting model that does not reflect the economics for transactions
involving  Farmer  Mac's  callable  swaps,  in  management's  view the  non-GAAP
measures  provide  a more  accurate  representation  of  Farmer  Mac's  economic
performance,  transaction  economics  and  business  trends.  Investors  and the
investment  analyst  community have previously  relied upon similar  measures to
evaluate  performance and issue projections.  These non-GAAP disclosures are not
intended to replace GAAP information but, rather, to supplement it.

     One such non-GAAP  measure is core earnings,  which Farmer Mac developed to
present  net  income  less  the  after-tax  effects  of SFAS  133,  and less the
after-tax net gains and losses on the repurchase of debt that,  prior to January
1, 2003, were reported as extraordinary  items.  Core earnings for the three and
six  months  ended  June  30,  2003  were  $5.8   million  and  $11.7   million,
respectively,  compared to $5.8 million and $11.1  million for the three and six
months ended June 30, 2002. The  reconciliation  of GAAP net income available to
common stockholders to core earnings is presented in the following table:

</TABLE>

     Effects of SFAS 133 on Accounting for Callable Interest Rate Swaps.  Farmer
Mac enters into financial derivative transactions principally to protect against
risk from the effects of market price or interest rate movements on the value of
certain  assets  and  future  cash flows or debt  issuance,  not for  trading or
speculative  purposes.  Farmer  Mac enters  into  interest  rate swap  contracts
principally to adjust the characteristics of the forecasted issuance of variable
rate  short  term  funding  to more  closely  match the cash  flow and  duration
characteristics of its longer-term  mortgage and other assets,  thereby reducing
interest rate risk.  Specifically,  interest rate swaps convert economically the
variable cash flows  related to the  forecasted  issuance of short-term  debt to
effectively   fixed-rate   medium-term   and  long-term  notes  that  match  the
anticipated  duration,  repricing  and  interest  rate  characteristics  of  the
corresponding assets. Since this strategy provides Farmer Mac with the same cash
flows as those that are inherent in the issuance of  medium-term  notes,  Farmer
Mac uses  either the bond market or the swap  market  based upon their  relative
pricing efficiencies.

     Farmer  Mac uses  callable  interest  rate swaps (in  conjunction  with the
issuance of short-term  debt) as an  alternative to callable  medium-term  notes
with equivalently  structured  maturities and call options.  The call options on
the swaps  are  designed  to match  the  implicit  prepayment  options  on those
mortgage  assets without  prepayment  protection.  The blended  durations of the
swaps are also  designed  to match the  duration  of the  mortgages  over  their
estimated  lives.  If the  mortgages  prepay,  the swaps  can be called  and the
short-term  debt  repaid;  if the  mortgages  do not  prepay,  the swaps  remain
outstanding  and the  short-term  debt is  rolled  over,  effectively  providing
fixed-rate callable funding over the lives of the mortgages. Thus, the economics
of the assets are closely matched to the economics of the interest rate swap and
funding combination.

     The callable interest rate swaps are recorded at fair value on Farmer Mac's
balance  sheet  with  the  related  changes  in  fair  value  recognized  in the
consolidated  statement of  operations.  Although  Farmer Mac believes that this
strategy  achieves  its economic and risk  management  objectives,  the FASB has
adopted a mixed  attribute  accounting  model for  callable  swaps that does not
reflect the  economics of the  transactions.  Pursuant to that model,  while the
issuance of a callable  medium-term  note is recorded at  historical  cost,  the
economic  equivalent  (the  issuance  of short  term-debt  with  the  forecasted
rollover of that debt and the simultaneous  issuance of a callable interest rate
swap) is recorded  differently  (the  discount  notes are recorded at historical
cost and the interest rate swap is recorded at fair value).  Despite the closely
matched economics and optionality of the assets and the associated interest rate
swap and  funding  combination,  the  callable  swaps do not  qualify  for hedge
accounting  under SFAS 133 because the test for hedge  effectiveness  under SFAS
133 is based on the linkage  between the forecasted  short-term  funding and the
callable  interest rate swap and ignores the prepayable  characteristics  of the
associated assets being funded.

      Business Volume. Loans are brought into the Farmer Mac I and Farmer Mac II
programs as follows:

     o    Farmer Mac purchases  eligible loans and guarantees timely payments of
          principal and interest of securities  backed by those loans as part of
          the Farmer Mac I program.  Farmer Mac may retain  some or all of those
          securities  in its  portfolio or sell them to third parties in capital
          markets transactions.
     o    Farmer Mac purchases  USDA-guaranteed portions of loans and guarantees
          timely  payments of  principal  and interest of  securities  backed by
          those guaranteed portions as part of the Farmer Mac II program. Farmer
          Mac may retain some or all of those  securities  in its  portfolio  or
          sell them to third parties in capital markets transactions.
     o    Farmer Mac also enters into LTSPCs for  eligible  loans.  Farmer Mac's
          commitments through LTSPCs include either newly originated or seasoned
          eligible loans, and are part of the Farmer Mac I program.
     o    Farmer Mac exchanges  Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities  for eligible
          loans or  USDA-guaranteed  portions of loans  ("swaps").  Farmer Mac's
          swaps of Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities for USDA-guaranteed portions
          of loans are part of the Farmer Mac II program;  Farmer Mac's swaps of
          Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities for any other eligible loans are part
          of the Farmer Mac I program.

     The  following  table  sets forth the amount of all Farmer Mac I and Farmer
Mac II loan purchase and guarantee  activities for newly  originated and current
seasoned loans during the periods indicated.

     The purchase  price of newly  originated  and seasoned  eligible  loans and
portfolios purchased by Farmer Mac (none of which were delinquent at the time of
purchase) is the fair value based on current  market  interest  rates and Farmer
Mac's target net yield,  which  includes an amount to compensate  Farmer Mac for
credit risk that is similar to the guarantee or  commitment  fee it receives for
accepting credit risk on loans underlying  Post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed
Securities  and LTSPCs.  As part of  fulfilling  its guarantee  obligations  for
Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities and assumption of credit risk on commitments
to purchase  eligible loans underlying  LTSPCs,  Farmer Mac purchases  defaulted
loans (all of which are at least 90 days delinquent at the time of purchase) out
of those  securities and pools. The purchase price for defaulted loans purchased
out of Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities is the current outstanding  principal
balance of the loan plus accrued and unpaid  interest.  The  purchase  price for
defaulted loans purchased  under an LTSPC is the current  outstanding  principal
balance of the loan,  with accrued and unpaid  interest on the  defaulted  loans
payable out of any future loan payments or liquidation  proceeds  received.  The
following  table presents  Farmer Mac's loan  purchases of newly  originated and
current  seasoned loans and defaulted  loans purchased  underlying  Farmer Mac I
Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs.

</TABLE>

     The decrease in newly  originated  and current  seasoned loan purchases was
attributable to a decrease in newly originated Farmer Mac I loan purchases and a
large portfolio  purchase in second quarter 2002 that has not been replicated in
2003.  The  increases  in  defaulted  loans  purchased  and in  defaulted  loans
transferred to loans reflect:

     o    Farmer Mac's  practice of purchasing  90-day  delinquent  loans out of
          Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities; and
     o    recordation in the  consolidated  financial  statements of other loans
          over which Farmer Mac regained effective control during the period.

With respect to the second circumstance cited, when particular criteria are met,
such as the default of the borrower, Farmer Mac becomes entitled to exercise its
option  to  purchase  the  defaulted  loans  underlying  Farmer  Mac  Guaranteed
Securities  (these  options are  commonly  referred  to as  "removal-of-account"
provisions).  Farmer  Mac  records  these  loans in the  consolidated  financial
statements  during the period in which  Farmer Mac has the option to  repurchase
the loans and therefore regains effective control over the transferred loans.

     The  weighted-average  age of the Farmer Mac I newly originated and current
seasoned loans purchased  during second quarter 2003 and second quarter 2002 was
less than one month and four  months,  respectively.  Of the  Farmer Mac I newly
originated and current  seasoned loans purchased  during second quarter 2003 and
second  quarter  2002,  75 percent and 83 percent,  respectively,  had principal
amortization  periods  longer  than the  maturity  date,  resulting  in  balloon
payments at maturity, with a weighted-average remaining term to maturity of 15.1
years and 10.1 years, respectively. The weighted-average age of delinquent loans
purchased out of  securitized  pools and LTSPCs  during second  quarter 2003 and
second quarter 2002 was 6.1 years and 4.5 years, respectively.

     Indicators of future loan purchase and guarantee  volume (but not of future
LTSPC,  swap  or  portfolio  purchase  volume)  in  the  immediately  succeeding
reporting period include  outstanding  commitments to purchase loans (other than
under an  LTSPC)  and the total  balance  of loans  submitted  for  approval  or
approved but not yet purchased. Many purchase commitments entered into by Farmer
Mac  are  mandatory  delivery  commitments.  If a  seller  obtains  a  mandatory
commitment and is unable to deliver the loans as required thereunder, Farmer Mac
requires the seller to pay a fee to modify, extend or cancel the commitment.  As
of June 30, 2003, outstanding commitments to purchase Farmer Mac I loans totaled
$10.7  million,  compared  to $15.6  million as of June 30,  2002.  Of the total
Farmer Mac I commitments  outstanding as of June 30, 2003 and 2002, $3.6 million
and $10.6 million, respectively, were mandatory commitments. Loans submitted for
approval or approved but not yet committed to purchase  totaled $59.8 million as
of June 30,  2003,  compared to $86.1  million as of June 30,  2002.  Not all of
these  loans will be  purchased,  as some will  ultimately  be denied for credit
reasons or withdrawn by the seller.

     While significant progress has been made in developing the secondary market
for  agricultural  mortgages,  Farmer Mac  continues to face the  challenges  of
establishing a market where none previously existed.  Acceptance of Farmer Mac's
programs is increasing among lenders,  reflecting the competitive  rates,  terms
and products offered and the advantages Farmer Mac's programs provide, including
increased  liquidity  and lending  capacity.  As of June 30, 2003,  Farmer Mac's
outstanding program volume was $5.6 billion, which represented approximately 12%
of  management's  estimate  of a $46  billion  market of  eligible  agricultural
mortgage loans. For Farmer Mac to succeed in realizing its business  development
and  profitability  objectives  over the longer  term,  the use of Farmer  Mac's
programs and products by agricultural  mortgage lenders,  whether traditional or
non-traditional, must continue to expand.

     New business  volume was down for the first six months of 2003  compared to
the same period in 2002. Farmer Mac believes this trend is traceable to:

     o    general  conditions in the agricultural  mortgage market affecting all
          agricultural  mortgage  lenders,  including  the  reduced  interest of
          borrowers in long-term fixed rate financing;
     o    diminished  expansion in the capital intensive livestock and permanent
          crop sectors; and
     o    residual effects of adverse  publicity based on  misinformation  about
          Farmer Mac disseminated in 2002.

Nonetheless,  lender  interest in Farmer Mac has produced a steady stream of new
volume  in the  form  of  Farmer  Mac I and II  individual  loan  purchases  and
additions to existing LTSPC arrangements during 2003. The outlook for the second
half of 2003 is for new  volume to  approximate  the level of the first  half of
2003.  Farmer Mac believes  that  prospects  for larger  portfolio  transactions
similar  to those that have  accounted  for a  significant  portion of growth in
prior years continue to exist,  but no assurance can be given at this time as to
the certainty or timing of such  transactions.  Growth in Farmer Mac's  business
volume  is  dependent  on both an  increase  in its  market  share  of  existing
agricultural  mortgages and continued growth in the total agricultural  mortgage
market.

     As of June 30, 2003, there were 124 approved loan sellers in the Farmer Mac
I program  ranging from  single-office  to multi-branch  institutions,  spanning
community banks,  Farm Credit System  associations,  mortgage  companies,  large
multi-state Farm Credit System banks,  commercial banks and insurance companies.
The increase of 53 approved sellers from the 71 approved sellers as of March 31,
2003 resulted primarily from the recertification of sellers who had not provided
necessary  certification  information as of the earlier date. During 2002, there
were 79 approved loan sellers active in the Farmer Mac I program. In addition to
participating  directly in the Farmer Mac I program,  some of the approved  loan
sellers  enable  other  lenders to  participate  indirectly  in the Farmer Mac I
program by managing  correspondent  networks of lenders from which they purchase
loans to sell to Farmer  Mac.  As of June 30,  2003,  more than 75 lenders  were
participating  in those  networks,  bringing  the  total  Farmer  Mac I  program
participants to more than 200 as of June 30, 2003.

     To be  considered  for  approval  as a Farmer  Mac I  seller,  a  financial
institution must meet criteria established by Farmer Mac, including:

     o    owning a  requisite  amount  of  Farmer  Mac Class A or Class B voting
          common stock according to a schedule  prescribed for the size and type
          of institution;
     o    having  the  ability  and  experience  to make or  purchase  and  sell
          agricultural mortgage loans of the type that will qualify for purchase
          by Farmer Mac and service such mortgage  loans in accordance  with the
          Farmer  Mac  requirements  either  through  its own  staff or  through
          contractors and originators;
     o    maintaining a minimum adjusted net worth of $1.0 million;
     o    maintaining  a  fidelity  bond  and  errors  and  omissions  insurance
          coverage (or acceptable substitute insurance coverage) in a prescribed
          amount according to the size of the institution; and
     o    entering into a Seller/Servicer  agreement to comply with the terms of
          the Farmer Mac Seller/Servicer  Guide,  including  representations and
          warranties regarding the eligibility of the loans and accuracy of loan
          data provided to Farmer Mac.

     Any lender  authorized by the USDA to obtain a USDA guarantee on a loan may
be a seller in the Farmer Mac II program.  As of June 30,  2003,  there were 179
active sellers in the Farmer Mac II program,  compared to 143 as of December 31,
2002 and 131 as of June 30, 2002.  Sellers in the Farmer Mac II program  consist
mostly of community and regional banks.

     In the aggregate,  more than 325 lenders were actively participating either
directly  or  indirectly  in one or both of the  Farmer  Mac I or Farmer  Mac II
programs as of June 30, 2003.

Balance Sheet Review

     During the six months ended June 30, 2003,  total assets increased by $44.9
million from December 31, 2002,  with  decreases in program  assets  (Farmer Mac
Guaranteed  Securities  and loans) of $26.6  million  (exclusive  of real estate
owned)  offset by  increases  in  non-program  assets.  For further  information
regarding on- and off-balance sheet program activities, see "--Off-Balance Sheet
Program  Activities" below.  Consistent with the increase in total assets during
the period, total liabilities  increased by $25.8 million from December 31, 2002
to June 30, 2003.

     During the six months ended June 30, 2003,  accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss) increased $0.2 million,  which is the net effect of a $5.5 million
increase in unrealized gains on securities available for sale and a $5.3 million
decrease  in the fair value of  financial  derivatives  classified  as cash flow
hedges.  Accumulated  other  comprehensive  income  (loss) is not a component of
Farmer Mac's core capital or regulatory capital.

     As of June 30,  2003,  Farmer Mac's core capital  totaled  $202.9  million,
compared to $184.0  million as of December 31, 2002.  As of June 30, 2003,  core
capital  exceeded Farmer Mac's statutory  minimum capital  requirement of $138.8
million by $64.1 million.

     FCA issued its final risk-based  capital regulation for Farmer Mac on April
12,  2001.  Farmer Mac was  required to meet the  risk-based  capital  standards
beginning on May 23, 2002. The risk-based capital stress test promulgated by FCA
is intended to determine  the amount of  regulatory  capital  (core capital plus
allowance  for losses) that Farmer Mac would need to maintain  positive  capital
during a ten-year period in which:

     o    losses occur at a rate of default and severity "reasonably related" to
          the  rates of the  highest  sequential  two  years in a  limited  U.S.
          geographic area; and
     o    there is an  initial  interest  rate  shock at the lesser of 600 basis
          points or 50 percent of the ten-year U.S.  Treasury rate, and interest
          rates remain at such level for the remainder of the period.

The  risk-based  capital  stress test then adds an  additional 30 percent to the
resulting capital requirement for management and operational risk.

     Farmer Mac was in compliance  with the risk-based  capital  standards under
the regulation as of June 30, 2003. As of June 30, 2003, the risk-based  capital
stress test generated a regulatory capital requirement of $45.4 million.  Farmer
Mac's regulatory capital of $224.8 million exceeded that amount by approximately
$179.4 million. The decrease in the risk-based capital requirement from December
31, 2002  ($73.4  million)  to June 30,  2003  ($45.4  million)  was a result of
changes in the  interest  rate  environment  and the ageing of Farmer Mac's loan
portfolio. Farmer Mac is required to hold capital at the higher of the statutory
minimum  capital  requirement or the amount  required by the risk-based  capital
stress test.

Off-Balance Sheet Program Activities

     Farmer Mac offers  approved  agricultural  and rural  residential  mortgage
lenders two  off-balance  sheet  alternatives  to increase  their  liquidity  or
lending  capacity  while  retaining the cash flow  benefits of their loans:  (1)
Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities,  which are available through either the Farmer
Mac I program or the Farmer Mac II program,  and (2) LTSPCs, which are available
only through the Farmer Mac I program.

     To be eligible for the Farmer Mac I program,  a loan must meet Farmer Mac's
credit underwriting,  appraisal and documentation standards. Accordingly, Farmer
Mac  believes  the credit risk it assumes for Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities
backed by loans that are eligible for the Farmer Mac I program and for LTSPCs is
the same and considers the effects of all on- and off-balance  sheet  activities
on its overall portfolio  diversification  and credit risk. See Note 2 to Farmer
Mac's condensed  consolidated  financial statements above for more detail on the
Corporation's off-balance sheet program activities.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Management

     Interest  Rate Risk.  Farmer Mac is  subject to  interest  rate risk on all
assets held for investment  because of possible  timing  differences in the cash
flows of the assets and related  liabilities.  This risk is primarily related to
loans held and  Farmer  Mac  Guaranteed  Securities  because  of the  ability of
borrowers to prepay their  mortgages  before the scheduled  maturities,  thereby
increasing  the risk of asset  and  liability  cash flow  mismatches.  Cash flow
mismatches in a changing  interest rate  environment  can reduce the earnings of
the  Corporation  if assets repay sooner than  expected and the  resulting  cash
flows must be reinvested in lower-yielding investments when Farmer Mac's funding
costs  cannot be  correspondingly  reduced,  or if assets repay more slowly than
expected and the associated debt must be replaced by higher-cost debt.

     Yield maintenance  provisions and other prepayment  penalties  contained in
many agricultural  mortgage loans reduce, but do not eliminate,  this prepayment
risk, particularly in the case of a defaulted loan where yield maintenance might
not be  collected.  Those  provisions  require  borrowers to make an  additional
payment when they prepay their loans,  so that, when reinvested with the prepaid
principal, yield maintenance payments generate substantially the same cash flows
that would have been generated had the loan not prepaid. Those provisions create
a  disincentive  to prepayment  and in the event of  prepayment,  compensate the
Corporation for its interest rate risks to a large degree.  As of June 30, 2003,
54 percent  of the  outstanding  balance of all loans held and loans  underlying
on-balance sheet Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities (including 90 percent of all
loans with fixed interest  rates) were covered by yield  maintenance  provisions
and other  prepayment  penalties.  Of the  Farmer  Mac I new and  current  loans
purchased in second  quarter 2003, 12 percent had yield  maintenance  or another
form of  prepayment  protection  (including  56  percent of all loans with fixed
interest rates). None of the  USDA-guaranteed  portions underlying Farmer Mac II
Guaranteed Securities had yield maintenance provisions.

     Taking  into  consideration  the  prepayment  provisions  and  the  default
probabilities  associated with its mortgage  assets,  Farmer Mac uses prepayment
models to project and value cash flows  associated  with these  assets.  Because
borrowers'  behavior in various interest rate environments may change over time,
Farmer Mac periodically  evaluates the effectiveness of these models compared to
actual prepayment  experience and adjusts and refines the models as necessary to
improve the precision of subsequent  prepayment forecasts.  In addition,  Farmer
Mac consults with independent prepayment experts as part of the model evaluation
process.

     The goal of  Farmer  Mac's  interest-rate-risk  management  is to  create a
portfolio that generates  stable earnings and value across a variety of interest
rate environments. Farmer Mac's primary strategy for managing interest rate risk
is to fund asset purchases with liabilities that have similar  durations so that
they will perform  similarly as interest  rates  change.  To achieve this match,
Farmer Mac issues  discount  notes and  medium-term  notes  across a spectrum of
maturities.  Additionally,  Farmer  Mac  issues  callable  debt  to  offset  the
prepayment  risk  associated  with  some  mortgage  assets.  By using a blend of
liabilities that includes callable debt, the interest rate  sensitivities of the
liabilities  tend to increase or decrease as interest  rates  change in a manner
similar to changes in the interest rate sensitivities of the assets.  Farmer Mac
also uses  financial  derivatives  to better  match the  durations of assets and
liabilities thereby reducing overall interest rate sensitivity.

     Farmer Mac's  $620.6  million of cash and cash  equivalents  as of June 30,
2003 matures within three months and are match-funded with discount notes having
similar maturities.  Investment securities of $976.3 million as of June 30, 2003
consist of $742.6  million (76.1 percent) of floating rate  securities  that all
have rates that adjust  within one year.  These  floating rate  investments  are
funded using a series of discount note issuances.  Each successive discount note
issuance  matures on or about the  corresponding  repricing  date of the related
investment.

     Farmer Mac is also subject to interest rate risk on loans,  including loans
that Farmer Mac has committed to acquire but has not yet purchased.  When Farmer
Mac commits to purchase a loan,  it is exposed to interest rate risk between the
time it commits to purchase the loan and the time it either:

     o    sells Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities backed by the loan; or
     o    issues debt to retain the loan in its portfolio (although issuing debt
          to fund the loan as an investment  does not fully  eliminate  interest
          rate risk due to the possible timing  differences in the cash flows of
          the assets and related liabilities, as discussed above).

Farmer Mac manages the interest rate risk related to such loans, and any related
Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities or debt  issuance,  through the use of forward
sale   contracts   on  the  debt  and   mortgage-backed   securities   of  other
government-sponsored  enterprises and futures contracts  involving U.S. Treasury
securities.  Farmer Mac uses  forward  sale  contracts  on  government-sponsored
enterprise  securities  to reduce its interest  rate exposure to changes in both
Treasury  rates and  spreads  on Farmer  Mac debt and  Farmer  Mac I  Guaranteed
Securities.

     Since interest rate  sensitivity may change with the passage of time and as
interest rates change,  Farmer Mac assesses this exposure on a regular basis and
rebalances its portfolio of assets and liabilities as necessary through:

     o    purchasing mortgage assets in the ordinary course of business;
     o    refunding existing liabilities; or
     o    using derivatives to alter the  characteristics  of existing assets or
          liabilities.

     The most  strenuous  measure  of the  interest  rate risk of  Farmer  Mac's
current  portfolio is the  sensitivity  of its Market Value of Equity ("MVE") to
parallel yield curve shocks. MVE represents the present value of all future cash
flows from on- and off-balance sheet assets,  liabilities,  including  financial
derivatives,  discounted at current  interest  rates and spreads.  The following
schedule  summarizes the results of Farmer Mac's MVE sensitivity  analysis as of
June 30, 2003 and December 31, 2002 to an immediate and  instantaneous  parallel
shift in the yield curve.

*    As of the date  indicated,  a -200 bp parallel  shift of the U. S. Treasury
     yield curve produced  negative interest rates for maturities of 2 years and
     shorter.
</TABLE>

     During  2002 and  through  second  quarter  2003,  interest  rates  fell to
historic lows and interest rate volatility increased significantly.  Despite the
volatile interest rate environment, Farmer Mac maintained a relatively low level
of  interest  rate  sensitivity  during  second  quarter  2003  through  ongoing
asset/liability  rebalancing  activities.  As of June  30,  2003,  Farmer  Mac's
effective  duration gap,  another  standard  measure of interest rate risk,  was
improved  to minus 1.2 months,  compared to minus 3.6 months as of December  31,
2002, as a result of the rebalancing  activities conducted during second quarter
2003.  As of both June 30, 2003 and December 31, 2002,  Farmer Mac's MVE and net
interest income ("NII") showed positive sensitivity to increasing interest rates
and negative sensitivity to continued decreases in interest rates.

     As of June 30, 2003, a uniform or  "parallel"  increase of 100 basis points
would have increased  NII, a shorter-term  measure of interest rate risk, by 7.6
percent,  while a parallel decrease of 100 basis points would have decreased NII
by 7.8 percent.  Farmer Mac also measures the sensitivity of both MVE and NII to
a variety  of  non-parallel  interest  rate  shocks,  including  flattening  and
steepening yield curve scenarios. Both MVE and NII continue to be less sensitive
to non-parallel  shocks than to the parallel  shocks.  The sensitivity of Farmer
Mac's MVE and NII to both parallel and  non-parallel  interest rate shocks,  and
its duration  gap, are  indicators  of the  effectiveness  of the  Corporation's
approach to managing its interest rate risk exposures.

      The economic effects of financial derivatives, including interest rate
swaps, are included in the MVE, NII and duration gap analyses. Farmer Mac
generally enters into various interest rate swaps to reduce interest rate risk
as follows:

     o    "floating-to-fixed  interest  rate swaps" in which it pays fixed rates
          of  interest  to,  and  receives  floating  rates  of  interest  from,
          counterparties;  these swaps adjust the  characteristics of short-term
          debt to match more closely the cash flow and duration  characteristics
          of longer-term reset and fixed-rate mortgages and other assets and may
          provide  an  overall  lower  effective  cost of  borrowing  than would
          otherwise be available in the conventional debt market;
     o    "fixed-to-floating  interest  rate swaps" in which it  receives  fixed
          rates of  interest  from,  and pays  floating  rates of  interest  to,
          counterparties;  these swaps adjust the  characteristics  of long-term
          debt to match more closely the cash flow and duration  characteristics
          of short-term assets; and
     o    "basis swaps" in which it pays variable rates of interest based on one
          index to, and  receives  variable  rates of interest  based on another
          index from, counterparties; these swaps alter interest rate indices of
          liabilities to match those of assets, and vice versa.

As of June 30, 2003,  Farmer Mac had $1.182 billion combined  notional amount of
interest  rate  swaps with terms  ranging  from one month to 15 years.  Of those
interest rate swaps,  $703.0 million were  floating-to-fixed  rate interest rate
swaps, $378.7 million were basis swaps and $100.0 million were fixed-to-floating
interest rate swaps.

     Farmer  Mac  employs  financial  derivatives  as an  end-user  for  hedging
purposes,  not for trading or speculative  purposes.  When financial derivatives
meet the specific  hedge  criteria  under SFAS 133,  they are  accounted  for as
either fair value hedges or cash flow hedges.  Financial derivatives that do not
satisfy those hedge  criteria are not accounted for as hedges and changes in the
fair value of those  financial  derivatives  are  reported  as a gain or loss on
financial  derivatives  and trading  assets in the  consolidated  statements  of
operations.  All of Farmer Mac's financial derivative transactions are conducted
under  standard  collateralized  agreements  that limit Farmer  Mac's  potential
credit  exposure to any  counterparty.  As of June 30,  2003,  Farmer Mac had no
uncollateralized net exposure to any counterparty.

     Credit Risk.  Farmer Mac's  primary  exposure to credit risk is the risk of
loss resulting  from the inability of a borrower to repay the mortgage  combined
with a  deficiency  in  the  value  of the  collateral  relative  to the  amount
outstanding on the mortgage and the costs of liquidation.  Farmer Mac is exposed
to credit risk on:

     o    loans it holds;
     o    loans underlying Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities; and
     o    loans underlying LTSPCs.

Loans held or loans underlying Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities or LTSPCs can be
divided into four groups:

     o    loans held for investment;
     o    loans underlying pre-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities;
     o    loans underlying  Post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities or
          LTSPCs; and
     o    USDA-guaranteed   portions   underlying   Farmer  Mac  II   Guaranteed
          Securities.

     For loans underlying pre-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities,  ten
percent  first-loss  subordinated  interests  mitigate  Farmer Mac's credit risk
exposure.  Before  Farmer Mac incurs a credit loss,  full recourse must first be
taken  against  the   subordinated   interest.   The  1996  Act  eliminated  the
subordinated interest requirement. As a result, Farmer Mac generally assumes 100
percent of the credit  risk on loans held for  investment  and loans  underlying
Post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs. Farmer Mac's credit
exposure on USDA-guaranteed  portions is covered by the full faith and credit of
the United States.  Farmer Mac believes it has little or no credit risk exposure
to loans underlying  pre-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities because of
the subordinated interests,  or to USDA-guaranteed  portions because of the USDA
guarantee.  The outstanding principal balance of loans held and loans underlying
Farmer  Mac  Guaranteed  Securities  (including  AgVantage  bonds)  or LTSPCs is
summarized in the table below.

     For  several  years,  Farmer  Mac  has  conducted  guarantee  fee  adequacy
analyses,  using stress-test models developed internally and with the assistance
of outside  experts.  These  analyses  have taken into  account  the diverse and
dissimilar  characteristics of the various asset categories for which Farmer Mac
manages its risk exposures,  and have evolved as the mix and character of assets
under management has shifted with growth in the business and the addition of new
asset  categories.  Based on current  information,  Farmer Mac believes that its
guarantee fee is adequate compensation for the credit risk that it assumes.

     Farmer  Mac  has  established  underwriting,  appraisal  and  documentation
standards  for  agricultural  mortgage  loans to mitigate  the risk of loss from
borrower   defaults  and  to  provide   guidance   concerning  the   management,
administration  and conduct of underwriting and appraisals to all  participating
sellers and potential sellers in its programs. These standards were developed on
the basis of industry norms for agricultural  mortgage loans and are designed to
assess  the  creditworthiness  of the  borrower,  as  well as the  value  of the
collateral   securing   the  loan.   Farmer   Mac   requires   sellers  to  make
representations  and warranties  regarding the  conformity of eligible  mortgage
loans to these  standards,  the accuracy of loan data provided to Farmer Mac and
other requirements related to the loans.

     Farmer Mac I credit  underwriting  standards require that the loan-to-value
("LTV") ratio for any loan not exceed 70 percent,  except that a loan secured by
a livestock  facility and supported by a contract with an  integrator  (e.g.,  a
food processing  company) may have an LTV ratio of up to 75 percent, a part-time
farm loan supported by private mortgage insurance may have an LTV ratio of up to
85 percent and a rural housing loan supported by private mortgage  insurance may
have an LTV ratio of up to 97  percent.  In the case of newly  originated  loans
that are not part-time farm or rural housing loans, borrowers on the loans must,
among other criteria set forth in Farmer Mac's underwriting standards, also meet
the following standard pro forma (that is, giving effect to the new loan) credit
ratios:

     o    debt-to-asset ratio of 50 percent or less;
     o    cash flow debt service coverage ratio on the mortgaged property of not
          less than 1:1;
     o    total debt service coverage ratio, including farm and non-farm income,
          of not less than 1.25:1; and
     o    ratio of current assets to current liabilities of not less than 1:1.

     Farmer Mac's underwriting standards provide for acceptance of loans that do
not conform to one or more of the standard  underwriting  ratios, other than LTV
ratio, when:

     o    those  loans  exceed one or more of the  underwriting  standards  to a
          degree  that  compensates  for  noncompliance  with one or more  other
          standards, referred to as compensating strengths; and
     o    those  loans  are  made  to  producers  of   particular   agricultural
          commodities  in a segment of  agriculture  in which such  compensating
          strengths are typical of the financial condition of sound borrowers in
          that segment.

Farmer  Mac's use of  compensating  strengths is not intended to provide a basis
for waiving or lessening the requirement that eligible  mortgage loans under the
Farmer Mac I program be of consistently high quality. In fact, loans approved on
the basis of compensating strengths have historically  demonstrated a lower rate
of  default  than that of loans that  conformed  to all of the  standard  credit
ratios.  As of June 30,  2003,  a total of $1.5  billion  (31.3  percent) of the
outstanding  balance of loans held and loans underlying LTSPCs and Post-1996 Act
Farmer  Mac I  Guaranteed  Securities  were  approved  based  upon  compensating
strengths. During second quarter 2003, $75.3 million (30.8 percent) of the loans
purchased or added under LTSPCs were approved based upon compensating strengths.

     In the case of a seasoned loan, Farmer Mac considers sustained  performance
to be a reliable  alternative  indicator of a borrower's ability to pay the loan
according to its terms.  A seasoned  loan  generally  will be deemed an eligible
loan if:

     o    it  has  been   outstanding   for  at  least  five  years  and  has  a
          loan-to-value ratio of 60 percent or less;
     o    there  have  been no  payments  on the loan more than 30 days past due
          during the previous three years; and
     o    there have been no material restructurings or modifications for credit
          reasons during the previous five years.

     A seasoned loan that has been  outstanding  for more than one year but less
than five years must  substantially  comply with the underwriting  standards for
newly originated loans as of the date the loan was originated by the lender. The
loan must also have a payment  history  that shows no payment  more than 30 days
past due during the three-year period  immediately prior to the date the loan is
either  purchased  by  Farmer  Mac or made  subject  to an  LTSPC.  As with  the
secondary  market for residential  mortgages,  there is no requirement that each
loan's compliance with the underwriting  standards be re-evaluated  after Farmer
Mac accepts the loan into its program.

     The due  diligence  Farmer Mac  performs  before  purchasing,  guaranteeing
securities backed by, or committing to purchase, seasoned loans includes:

     o    evaluation of loan database information to determine conformity to the
          criteria described above;
     o    confirmation that loan file data conform to database information;
     o    validation of supporting credit information in the loan files; and
     o    review of loan collateral appraisals.

All of the foregoing are performed  through  methods that give due regard to the
size, age, leverage and nature of the collateral for the loans.

     In the case of rural  housing and  part-time  farm loans,  the borrower may
finance up to 97 percent and 85 percent, respectively, of the appraised value of
the  property  if the amount  above 80  percent  is covered by private  mortgage
insurance. For newly originated part-time farm loans, the borrower must generate
sufficient income from all sources to repay all creditors. A borrower's capacity
to repay debt obligations generally is determined by two tests:

     o    the borrower's monthly mortgage  payment-to-income  ratio should be 28
          percent or less; and
     o    the borrower's total monthly debt payment-to-income ratio should be 36
          percent or less.

     Farmer Mac's appraisal standards for newly originated loans require,  among
other things,  that the  appraisal  function be performed  independently  of the
credit  decision-making   process  and  conform  to  the  Uniform  Standards  of
Professional  Appraisal Practice  promulgated by the Appraisal  Standards Board.
Farmer Mac's appraisal  standards require the appraisal function to be conducted
or administered by an individual  meeting specific  qualification and competence
criteria and who:

     o    is not  associated,  except by the engagement for the appraisal,  with
          the credit  underwriters  making the loan  decision,  though  both the
          appraiser  and the credit  underwriter  may be directly or  indirectly
          employed by a common employer;
     o    receives no financial or professional benefit of any kind by virtue of
          the report content,  valuation or credit decision made or based on the
          appraisal product; and
     o    has no present or contemplated  future direct or indirect  interest in
          the appraised property.

The appraisal  standards also require uniform reporting of reliable and credible
opinions   of  the  market   value,   market  rent  and   property   net  income
characteristics of the mortgaged property and the relative market forces.

     Farmer Mac requires current  collateral  valuations in conformance with the
Uniform Standards of Professional  Appraisal Practice for newly originated loans
purchased  or placed  under a Farmer Mac I  Guaranteed  Security  or LTSPC.  For
seasoned loans, Farmer Mac obtains appraisal updates as considered  necessary by
its assessment of collateral risk determined in the due diligence process.

     Farmer Mac  maintains an allowance for losses to cover  estimated  probable
losses on loans  held,  real estate  owned and loans  underlying  Post-1996  Act
Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities  and LTSPCs in accordance  with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies ("SFAS 5") and
Statement of Financial  Accounting Standard No. 114, Accounting by Creditors for
Impairment of a Loan ("SFAS 114"). The methodology for determining the allowance
for  losses  is the same for loans  held for  investment  and  loans  underlying
Post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities  and LTSPCs because Farmer Mac
believes the ultimate credit risk is the same, i.e., the underlying agricultural
mortgage loans all meet the same credit  underwriting  and appraisal  standards.
For  accepting  the credit risk on loans  underlying  Post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I
Guaranteed  Securities  and  LTSPCs,  Farmer  Mac  receives  guarantee  fees and
commitment  fees,  respectively.  For loans held,  Farmer Mac receives  interest
income that includes a component  that  correlates to its guarantee  fee,  which
Farmer Mac views as compensation for accepting credit risk.

     No  allowance  for losses has been made for loans  underlying  Farmer Mac I
Guaranteed  Securities  issued prior to the 1996 Act or Farmer Mac II Guaranteed
Securities.  Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities issued prior to the 1996 Act are
supported by unguaranteed first-loss subordinated interests,  which are expected
to exceed the estimated credit losses on those loans.  USDA-guaranteed  portions
collateralizing  Farmer Mac II Guaranteed  Securities are obligations  backed by
the full  faith  and  credit  of the  United  States.  To date,  Farmer  Mac has
experienced  no credit  losses  on any  pre-1996  Act  Farmer  Mac I  Guaranteed
Securities or on any Farmer Mac II Guaranteed  Securities and does not expect to
incur any such losses in the future.

     Farmer Mac's  allowance for losses is presented in three  components on its
consolidated balance sheet:

     o    an "Allowance for loan losses" on loans held for investment;
     o    a valuation  allowance on real estate owned,  which is included in the
          balance sheet under "Real estate owned,  net of valuation  allowance";
          and
     o    an allowance for losses on loans underlying Post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I
          Guaranteed  Securities  and  LTSPCs,  which is included in the balance
          sheet under "Reserve for losses."

     Farmer Mac's  provision  for losses is presented in two  components  on its
consolidated statement of operations:

     o    a "Provision for loan losses," which represents losses on Farmer Mac's
          loans held for investment; and
     o    a "Provision for losses," which represents  losses on loans underlying
          Post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities  and LTSPCs and real
          estate owned.

     Farmer Mac's allowance for losses is estimated  using a systematic  process
that begins with management's  evaluation of the results of its proprietary loan
pool  simulation  and  guarantee fee model (the  "Model");  those results may be
modified by the  application  of  management's  judgment that takes into account
factors including:

     o    economic conditions;
     o    geographic and agricultural  commodity  concentrations in Farmer Mac's
          portfolio;
     o    the credit profile of Farmer Mac's portfolio;
     o    delinquency trends of Farmer Mac's portfolio;
     o    Farmer  Mac's  experience  in the  management  and sale of real estate
          owned; and
     o    historical   charge-off  and  recovery   activities  of  Farmer  Mac's
          portfolio.

     The Model offers historical loss experience on agricultural  mortgage loans
similar to those on which Farmer Mac has assumed  credit risk, but over a longer
period of time than Farmer Mac's own experience to date. Farmer Mac's systematic
methodology for determining its allowance for losses is expected to migrate over
time,  away from the Model and  toward  the  increased  use of Farmer  Mac's own
historical  portfolio loss experience,  as that experience continues to develop.
During this  migration,  Farmer Mac will  continue  to use the results  from the
Model,  augmented by the application of management's  judgment, to determine its
loan loss allowance.

     Management  believes that its use of this  methodology  produces a reliable
estimate of total probable  losses,  as of the balance sheet date, for all loans
included in Farmer Mac's portfolio,  including loans held, real estate owned and
loans underlying Post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs.

     In  addition,   Farmer  Mac   specifically   analyzes   its   portfolio  of
non-performing  assets  (loans  90  days  or  more  past  due,  in  foreclosure,
restructured,  in  bankruptcy,  including  loans  performing  under either their
original loan terms or a court-approved  bankruptcy plan, and real estate owned)
on a loan-by-loan  basis.  This analysis  measures  impairment based on the fair
value of the  underlying  collateral  for each  individual  loan relative to the
total amount due, including principal,  interest and advances under SFAS 114. In
the event that the updated  appraisal  or  management's  estimate of  discounted
collateral  value does not support the total amount due, Farmer Mac specifically
determines  an allowance  for the loan for the  difference  between the recorded
investment and its fair value, less estimated costs to liquidate the collateral.

     Management  believes that the general  allowance,  which is the  difference
between the total allowance for losses (generated  through use of the Model) and
the specific  allowances,  adequately covers any probable losses inherent in the
portfolio of performing loans under SFAS 5.

     Farmer  Mac  believes  that the  methodology  described  above  produces  a
reliable  estimate  of the total  probable  losses  inherent  in the  Farmer Mac
portfolio. The Model:

     o    runs various  configurations of loan types, terms, economic conditions
          and borrower  eligibility  criteria to generate a distribution of loss
          exposures over time for all loans in the portfolio;
     o    uses  historical   agricultural   real  estate  loan  origination  and
          servicing  data that reflect  varied  economic  conditions  and stress
          levels in the agricultural sector;
     o    contains  features that allow variations for changes in loan portfolio
          characteristics  to make the data set more  representative  of  Farmer
          Mac's portfolio and credit underwriting standards; and
     o    considers  the effects of the ageing of the loan  portfolio  along the
          expected loss curves  associated  with individual  cohort  origination
          years,  including the segments that are entering into or coming out of
          their peak default years.

     Farmer Mac analyzes  various  iterations  of the Model data to evaluate its
overall  allowance  for losses and back tests the results to validate the Model.
Such tests use prior period data to project losses  expected in a current period
and compare  those  projections  to actual  losses  incurred  during the current
period.

     The  allowance  for losses is increased  through  periodic  provisions  for
losses charged to expense and reduced by charge-offs  for actual losses,  net of
recoveries   that  are  recognized  if  liquidation   proceeds  exceed  previous
estimates.  Charge-offs  represent losses on the outstanding  principal balance,
any interest  payments  previously  accrued or advanced  and  expected  costs of
liquidation.

     The  following  table  summarizes  the changes in the  components of Farmer
Mac's  allowance for losses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2003 and
2002:

     When certain criteria are met, such as the default of the borrower,  Farmer
Mac has the  option to  purchase  the  defaulted  loans  underlying  Farmer  Mac
Guaranteed  Securities and is obligated to purchase  those  underlying an LTSPC.
These  acquisitions  are recorded in the  consolidated  financial  statements at
their fair value. Fair value is determined by appraisal or management's estimate
of discounted collateral value. In September 2002, Farmer Mac adopted EITF issue
02-9,  Accounting for Changes That Result in a Transferor  Regaining  Control of
Financial Assets Sold ("the consensus" or "EITF 02-9").  The consensus  requires
that Farmer Mac record,  at  acquisition,  the  difference  between  each loan's
acquisition  cost and its fair  value,  if any,  as a charge to the  reserve for
losses. Prior to the adoption of the consensus,  any specific allowance that had
been   established  for  the  off-balance   sheet  obligation  would  have  been
transferred  from the  reserve  for  losses  to the  allowance  for loan  losses
(referred to as "net allocation of the allowance" in the table above).  Upon the
receipt of each  loan's  updated  appraisal  or  determination  of  management's
estimate of discounted  collateral value, the difference between the acquisition
cost of the loan and its fair  value,  if any,  was  recorded as a charge to the
allowance for loan losses.

     Farmer Mac's total provision for losses was $2.1 million for second quarter
2003,  compared to $2.0 million for second  quarter 2002.  During second quarter
2003,  Farmer Mac charged off $1.3 million in losses  against the  allowance for
losses and had no recoveries. During second quarter 2002, Farmer Mac charged off
$0.9  million in losses  against the  allowance  for losses and  recovered  $0.2
million from previously charged off losses, for net charge-offs of $0.7 million.
As of June 30, 2003, Farmer Mac's allowance for losses totaled $21.9 million, or
45 basis  points of the  outstanding  principal  balance of loans held and loans
underlying Post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs, compared
to $20.0 million (42 basis points) as of December 31, 2002.

     As of June 30, 2003, loans held and loans  underlying  Post-1996 Act Farmer
Mac I  Guaranteed  Securities  and LTSPCs that were 90 days or more past due, in
foreclosure,  restructured  after  delinquency,  in bankruptcy  (including loans
performing under either their original loan terms or a court-approved bankruptcy
plan) and real estate owned  ("Post-1996  Act  non-performing  assets")  totaled
$80.2 million and represented 1.64 percent of the principal balance of all loans
held and loans underlying  Post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities and
LTSPCs, compared to $65.2 million (1.45 percent) as of June 30, 2002. Loans that
have been  restructured  after  delinquency were  insignificant and are included
within the reported 90-day delinquency and non-performing asset disclosures.  As
of June 30, 2003,  Farmer Mac's 90-day  delinquencies  totaled $51.3 million and
represented  1.06 percent of the  principal  balance of all loans held and loans
underlying Post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs, compared
to $50.3  million (1.12  percent) as of June 30, 2002.  From quarter to quarter,
Farmer Mac anticipates the 90-day delinquencies will fluctuate,  both in dollars
and as a percentage of the outstanding  portfolio,  with higher levels likely at
the end of the first  and  third  quarters  of each  year  corresponding  to the
semi-annual  (January 1st and July 1st) payment  characteristics  of most Farmer
Mac I loans.

non-performing assets and 90-day delinquencies:

</TABLE>

     As of June 30, 2003,  approximately  $1.8 billion (37.1  percent) of Farmer
Mac's  outstanding  loans held and loans  underlying  Post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I
Guaranteed  Securities  and LTSPCs  were in their peak  delinquency  and default
years compared to $1.7 billion (38.4 percent) of such loans as of June 30, 2002.
The  Model  takes  the   portfolio  age   distribution   and   maturation   into
consideration.  Accordingly,  those trends did not cause management to alter the
Model's projection for the provisions for losses.

     As of June 30,  2003,  Farmer  Mac's  loan-by-loan  analysis  of its  $80.2
million of  non-performing  assets and their updated  appraisals or management's
estimates  of  discounted  collateral  values  indicated  that $68.3  million of
non-performing assets were adequately collateralized, and that the allocation of
specific allowances to those loans was not necessary.  Farmer Mac's loan-by-loan
analyses indicated that the remaining $11.9 million had insufficient  collateral
to cover  the loan  balance,  accrued  interest  and  expenses.  Farmer  Mac has
specifically allocated $2.8 million of allowances to those  under-collateralized
loans.  As of June 30, 2003,  after the  allocation  of specific  allowances  to
under-collateralized  loans,  Farmer Mac had additional  non-specific or general
allowances of $19.1 million relating to inherent probable loss in the portfolio,
bringing the total allowance for losses to $21.9 million.  Based on Farmer Mac's
loan-by-loan analyses and loan collection  experience,  Farmer Mac believes that
specific and inherent  probable  losses are covered  adequately by the allowance
for losses.

     The  following  table  summarizes  Farmer Mac's  non-performing  assets and
allowance for losses:

</TABLE>

     Original  loan-to-value ratios are one of many factors Farmer Mac considers
in evaluating  loss  severity.  Other factors  include,  but are not limited to,
other  underwriting  standards,  commodity  and farming  forecasts  and regional
economic and agricultural conditions.  Loans in the Farmer Mac I program are all
first  mortgage  agricultural  real  estate  loans.  Accordingly,  Farmer  Mac's
exposure on a loan is limited to the difference between the total of the accrued
interest,  advances  and  principal  balance  of a loan  and  the  value  of the
property.  Measurement  of that excess or  shortfall is the best  predictor  and
determinant of loss compared to other measures that evaluate the efficiency of a
particular farm operator.

     Loan-to-value  ratios depend upon the economic value of a property with due
regard for its income-producing  potential in the hands of a competent operator.
As required by Farmer  Mac's  collateral  valuation  standards,  an appraisal of
agricultural   real  estate  must  include  analysis  of  the  income  producing
capability  of the  property  and  address  the  income  estimate  in the market
analysis. Debt service ratios depend upon farm operator efficiency and leverage,
which  can  vary  widely  within  a  geographic  region,  commodity  type  or an
operator's business and farming skills.

     As of June 30, 2003, the weighted-average  original loan-to-value ratio for
all loans  held and loans  underlying  Post-1996  Act  Farmer  Mac I  Guaranteed
Securities  and  LTSPCs  was  49  percent,  and  the  weighted-average  original
loan-to-value ratio for all Post-1996 Act non-performing assets was 57 percent.

     The following table summarizes the Post-1996 Act  non-performing  assets by
original  loan-to-value ratio (calculated by dividing the loan principal balance
at the time of guarantee,  purchase or commitment by the appraised  value at the
date of loan origination or, when available, updated appraised value at the time
of guarantee, purchase or commitment):

</TABLE>


     An analysis  of Farmer  Mac's  historical  losses and  identified  specific
collateral  deficiencies  within the portfolio (by  origination  year) indicates
that  Farmer Mac has  experienced  peak loss  years as loans  have aged  between
approximately their third and fifth years subsequent to origination,  regardless
of the year the loans were added to the Farmer Mac's portfolio. As a consequence
of the combination of principal  amortization and collateral value appreciation,
there  are few  loans  in the  portfolio  originated  prior to 1996  with  known
collateral deficiencies.  While Farmer Mac expects that there will be loans that
have aged  past  their  fifth  year that will  become  delinquent  and  possibly
default, Farmer Mac does not anticipate significant losses on such loans.

     Analysis of the  portfolio by its  geographic  and  commodity  distribution
indicates that losses and collateral  deficiencies have been and are expected to
remain most prevalent in the loans concentrated in the areas that do not receive
significant  government support.  This analysis is consistent with corresponding
commodity analysis,  which indicates that Farmer Mac has experienced higher loss
and collateral  deficiency rates in its loans classified as permanent plantings.
Most of the loans classified as permanent  plantings do not receive  significant
government   support   and   are   therefore   more   susceptible   to   adverse
commodity-specific  economic trends.  Further,  as adverse  economic  conditions
persist for a particular commodity that requires a long-term  improvement on the
land, such as permanent  plantings,  the  prospective  sale value of the land is
likely to decrease and the related loans may become under-collateralized. Farmer
Mac  anticipates  that one or more  particular  commodity  groups  will be under
economic pressure at any one time and actively manages its portfolio to mitigate
concentration  risks while preserving Farmer Mac's ability to meet the financing
needs of all commodity groups.

     Farmer Mac's  methodologies  for pricing its guarantee and commitment fees,
managing credit risks and providing adequate  allowances for losses consider all
of the foregoing factors and information.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

     Farmer Mac has  sufficient  liquidity and capital  resources to support its
operations  for the next twelve  months and has a  contingency  funding  plan to
handle unanticipated disruptions in its access to those resources.

     Debt Issuance.  Section 8.6(e) of Farmer Mac's statutory charter (12 U.S.C.
ss.  2279aa-6(e))  authorizes  Farmer Mac to issue debt  obligations to purchase
eligible  mortgage  loans and Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities and to maintain
reasonable amounts for business operations, including adequate liquidity. Farmer
Mac funds its  program  operations  primarily  by issuing  debt  obligations  of
various maturities in the public capital markets.  Farmer Mac's debt obligations
consist  of  discount  notes  and  medium-term  notes  issued  to  obtain  funds
principally  to cover the costs of purchasing  and holding loans and  securities
(including  Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities).  Farmer Mac also issues discount
notes and medium-term  notes to obtain funds for investments,  transaction costs
and guarantee payments.  The Corporation's  discount notes and medium-term notes
are  obligations  of Farmer Mac only, are not rated by any rating agency and the
interest and principal thereon are not guaranteed by and do not constitute debts
or obligations of FCA or the United States or any agency or  instrumentality  of
the United  States other than Farmer Mac.  Farmer Mac is an  institution  of the
Farm Credit  System,  but is not liable for any debt or  obligation of any other
institution of the Farm Credit System. Likewise,  neither the Farm Credit System
nor any other individual institution of the Farm Credit System is liable for any
debt or  obligation  of Farmer Mac.  Income on Farmer Mac's  discount  notes and
medium-term notes has no tax exemption under federal law from federal,  state or
local taxation.

     Farmer Mac's board of directors has  authorized  the issuance of up to $5.0
billion of  discount  notes and  medium-term  notes (of which $3.9  billion  was
outstanding as of June 30, 2003),  subject to periodic review of the adequacy of
that level relative to Farmer Mac's borrowing  requirements.  Farmer Mac invests
the proceeds of such issuances in loans,  Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities and
non-program  investment assets in accordance with guidelines  established by its
board of directors.

      Liquidity. The funding and liquidity needs of Farmer Mac's business
programs are driven by the purchase and retention of eligible loans and Farmer
Mac Guaranteed Securities, the maturities of Farmer Mac's discount notes and
medium-term notes and payment of principal and interest on Farmer Mac Guaranteed
Securities. Farmer Mac's primary sources of funds to meet these needs are:

     o    principal and interest  payments and ongoing  guarantee and commitment
          fees received on loans,  Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities and LTSPCs;
          and
     o    the issuance of discount  notes and  medium-term  notes in the capital
          markets.

     Farmer Mac  projects  its  expected  cash flows from loans and  securities,
other earnings and the sale of assets and matches those with its  obligations to
retire  debt and pay  other  liabilities  as they come due.  Farmer  Mac  issues
discount  notes  and  medium-term  notes to meet the needs  associated  with its
business operations,  including liquidity,  and also to increase its presence in
the capital markets in order to enhance the liquidity and pricing  efficiency of
its discount notes and  medium-term  notes and Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities
transactions  and so improve the mortgage rates  available to farmers,  ranchers
and rural homeowners.

     Though Farmer Mac's mortgage  purchases do not currently  necessitate daily
debt issuance,  the Corporation  continued its strategy of using its non-program
investment  portfolio  (referred  to as Farmer  Mac's  liquidity  portfolio)  to
facilitate  increasing its ongoing  presence in the capital markets during 2003.
To meet investor  demand for daily presence in the capital  markets,  Farmer Mac
issues  discount notes in maturities  ranging from one day to  approximately  90
days and  invests  the  proceeds  not  needed for  program  asset  purchases  in
highly-rated  securities.  Investments are predominantly short-term money market
securities with  maturities  closely matched to the discount note maturities and
floating-rate  securities  with  reset  terms of less than one year and  closely
matched to the maturity of the discount  notes.  The positive spread earned from
these  investments  enhances the net interest  income Farmer Mac earns,  thereby
improving the net yields at which Farmer Mac can purchase mortgages from lenders
who may pass that benefit to farmers,  ranchers and rural homeowners through the
Farmer Mac programs.  Subject to dollar limitations,  the Corporation's board of
directors has authorized non-program investments in:

     o    U.S. treasury obligations;
     o    agency and instrumentality obligations;
     o    repurchase agreements;
     o    commercial paper;
     o    guaranteed investment contracts;
     o    certificates of deposit;
     o    federal funds and bankers acceptances;
     o    certain  securities  and debt  obligations  of corporate and municipal
          issuers;
     o    asset-backed securities;
     o    corporate money market funds; and
     o    preferred stock of government-sponsored enterprises.

As of June 30, 2003,  Farmer Mac was in compliance  with the dollar  limitations
and investment authorizations set forth in its investment guidelines.

     As a result  of  Farmer  Mac's  regular  issuance  of  discount  notes  and
medium-term notes and its status as a federally chartered instrumentality of the
United  States,  Farmer  Mac has been  able to access  the  capital  markets  at
favorable  rates.  During  2003 and  throughout  the  period of  inaccurate  and
misleading  publicity about the Corporation  during 2002,  Farmer Mac maintained
regular  daily access to the  discount  note market at rates  comparable  to the
issuance and trading levels of other  government-sponsored  enterprise  discount
notes. Farmer Mac's continued ability to access the discount note market at such
favorable rates could be affected by further inaccurate and misleading publicity
about Farmer Mac or unusual trading in its securities.  Farmer Mac believes such
factors  caused spread  levels in secondary  market  trading of its  outstanding
medium-term  notes to widen during  second  quarter  2002.  Although  Farmer Mac
returned  to  issuing  medium-term  notes at  favorable  issuance  spreads,  the
foregoing  factors  could  affect  future   medium-term  note  issuance  spreads
adversely  and cause Farmer Mac to  emphasize  floating-to-fixed  interest  rate
swaps, combined with discount note issuances, as a source of fixed-rate funding.
While the swap market may  provide  favorable  fixed  rates,  swap  transactions
expose  Farmer Mac to the risk of future  widening of its own  issuance  spreads
versus  corresponding  LIBOR  rates.  If the spreads on the Farmer Mac  discount
notes  were to  increase  relative  to LIBOR,  Farmer  Mac would be exposed to a
commensurate  reduction on its net interest yield on the notional  amount of its
floating-to-fixed  interest  rate  swaps and  other  LIBOR-based  floating  rate
assets.  Farmer Mac  compensates for this risk by pricing the required net yield
on program  asset  purchases to reflect the cost of  medium-term  notes  without
regard to the savings that may be achievable in the interest rate swap market.

     Farmer Mac maintains an investment  portfolio of cash and cash  equivalents
(including  commercial paper and other short-term money market  instruments) and
investment securities consisting mostly of floating rate securities that reprice
within one year,  which can be drawn upon for  liquidity  needs.  As of June 30,
2003, Farmer Mac's cash and cash equivalents and investment  securities  totaled
$620.6  million and $976.3  million,  respectively,  a combined  37.4 percent of
total assets.  For second quarter 2003,  exclusive of daily  overnight  discount
note issuances that were invested overnight,  the average discount note issuance
term and re-funding frequency was approximately 64 days.

Other Matters

     On June 26, 2002,  the Senate  Committee  on  Agriculture,  Nutrition,  and
Forestry  requested that the GAO conduct an independent  analysis of a number of
issues  relating to Farmer Mac.  The  Committee  made this request of the GAO in
response to reports that Farmer Mac believes are misleading,  speculation  about
Farmer Mac produced by certain hedge funds acting as "short  sellers," who stood
to gain if the price of Farmer Mac  securities  was  depressed,  and  inaccurate
articles  published  by a reporter  for a major  newspaper.  Farmer Mac has made
clear that those reports and articles are inaccurate and misleading.

     It is  anticipated  that the analysis by the GAO would address Farmer Mac's
financial stability,  corporate governance,  compensation  policies,  investment
practices,  the  non-voting  status of Farmer Mac's Class C common stock and the
fulfillment  of Farmer  Mac's  Congressional  mission.  Farmer Mac  welcomes the
independent  analysis by the GAO as an  opportunity to remove any confusion that
has  been  cast  over its  integrity,  so that it may  continue  to  fulfill  it
Congressional mission in a financially safe and sound manner.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

     Farmer Mac is exposed to market  risk  attributable  to changes in interest
rates.  Farmer Mac manages this market risk by entering  into various  financial
transactions, including financial derivatives, and by monitoring its exposure to
changes  in  interest  rates.  See  "Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of
Financial  Condition  and Results of  Operations--Quantitative  and  Qualitative
Disclosures  About  Market  Risk   Management--Interest   Rate  Risk"  for  more
information  about Farmer Mac's exposure to interest rate risk and strategies to
manage such risk. For information  regarding  Farmer Mac's use of and accounting
policies for financial derivatives,  see Note 1(d) of the condensed consolidated
financial  statements.  See  "Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition  and  Results of  Operations--Liquidity  and  Capital  Resources"  for
further information regarding Farmer Mac's debt issuance and liquidity risks.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures

     Farmer Mac maintains  disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed in the Corporation's  periodic filings
under the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"),  including this
report, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis. These
disclosure  controls and procedures include controls and procedures  designed to
ensure that  information  required to be  disclosed  under the  Exchange  Act is
accumulated and communicated to the  Corporation's  management on a timely basis
to allow decisions regarding required  disclosure.  Farmer Mac's Chief Executive
Officer and Chief  Financial  Officer have  evaluated the  effectiveness  of the
design and operation of the Corporation's disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined under Rules  13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of June 30,
2003. Based upon that evaluation, Farmer Mac's Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer have concluded that the Corporation's  disclosure controls and
procedures  are  adequate  and  effective.  There have been no changes in Farmer
Mac's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter
ended June 30, 2003 that have materially  affected,  or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, the Corporation's internal controls over financial reporting.

                               EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT

     AGREED,  as of the 5th day of June 2003,  between the Federal  Agricultural
Mortgage  Corporation ("Farmer Mac") and Timothy L. Buzby ("Employee" or "you"),
that  the  following  terms  and  conditions   shall  apply  to  the  employment
relationship between the parties:

     1. Term. The term of your  employment  shall continue until June 1, 2007 or
any earlier  effective date of  termination  pursuant to Paragraph 7 hereof (the
"Term").

     2. Scope of  Authority  and  Employment.  You will  report  directly to the
President of Farmer Mac. You will have responsibility for the general accounting
affairs of the corporation  under business plans submitted by management to, and
approved  by, the Board of  Directors  of Farmer Mac. You shall be an officer of
Farmer Mac, with the title of Vice President - Controller.

     You will  devote  your best  efforts  and  substantially  all your time and
endeavor to your duties hereunder,  and you will not engage in any other gainful
occupation without the prior written consent of Farmer Mac;  provided,  however,
that this  provision will not be construed to prevent you from  personally,  and
for your own account or that of members of your immediate  family,  investing or
trading in real estate, stocks, bonds, securities,  commodities,  or other forms
of investment,  so long as such investing or trading is not in conflict with the
best interests of Farmer Mac. You will be employed to perform your duties at the
principal  office of Farmer Mac.  Notwithstanding  this, it is expected that you
will be required to travel a  reasonable  amount of time in the  performance  of
your duties under this Agreement.

     3.  Compensation.  Farmer  Mac  will  pay to you  the  following  aggregate
compensation for all services rendered by you under this Agreement:

          (a) Base  Salary.  You will be paid a base salary (the "Base  Salary")
     during  the  Term  of  One  Hundred  Seventy-Seven   Thousand  Two  Dollars
     ($177,002) per year, payable in arrears on a bi-weekly basis;

          (b) Incentive Compensation.  In addition to your Base Salary, you will
     be paid additional payments during the term of this Agreement in respect of
     the work  performed  by you during the  preceding  "Planning  Year" (June 1
     through  May 31),  or portion  thereof as  follows:  on June 1 of each year
     through and  including  the effective  date of  termination,  an additional
     payment in an amount at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors if it
     determines that you have performed in an extraordinary  manner your duties,
     pursuant to business plans proposed by management and approved by the Board
     of Directors, during the preceding Planning Year.

     4.  Expenses.  Farmer  Mac  will  reimburse  you for  your  reasonable  and
necessary  expenses  incurred in carrying out your duties under this  Agreement,
including, without limitation, expenses for: travel; attending approved business
meetings,  continuing legal education,  conventions and similar gatherings;  and
business  entertainment.  Reimbursement will be made to you within ten (10) days
after presentation to Farmer Mac of an itemized  accounting and documentation of
such  expenses.  You will notify the  President of Farmer Mac prior to incurring
any such expenses of an extraordinary or unusual nature.

     5. Vacation and Sick Leave.  You will be entitled to four (4) weeks of paid
vacation for each full  Planning Year during the Term of this  Agreement,  to be
taken in spans  not  exceeding  two (2)  weeks  each.  Vacation  rights  must be
exercised within two months after the end of the Planning Year or forfeited. You
will be entitled to reasonable and customary amounts of sick leave.

     6.  Employee  Benefits.  Farmer  Mac will  provide  you  with all  employee
benefits  regularly  provided to employees of Farmer Mac and the following other
(or upgraded)  benefits:  the best level of personal and family health insurance
obtainable by Farmer Mac on reasonable  terms;  an annual  medical  examination;
business travel and personal accident insurance; life insurance in the amount of
Two Hundred Fifty  Thousand  Dollars  ($250,000);  disability  benefits at least
equal to statutory  benefits in the District of Columbia;  participation  in the
Farmer Mac Pension Plan; and  participation in a savings plan established  under
Paragraph  401(k) of the Internal  Revenue Code.  The providers of any insurance
will be listed in Best's Insurance Guide. All of the foregoing is subject to the
limitation that the total cost thereof will not exceed twenty five percent (25%)
of your Base Salary, exclusive of administrative expense. In the event that such
cost  limitation  would be exceeded  in any year,  you may be required to select
from among the foregoing a group of benefits within that cost limitation.

   7. Termination.

          (a) Events of  Termination.  This Agreement will be terminated and the
     employment  relationship  between you and Farmer Mac will be severed as set
     forth below:

               (1) Farmer  Mac may  terminate  your  employment  effective  upon
          notice  to you  (or  your  legal  representative)  if  you  die or are
          incapacitated or disabled by accident,  sickness or otherwise so as to
          render you (in the opinion of an independent medical consultant on the
          full-time  faculty  of  Georgetown   University  School  of  Medicine)
          mentally or physically  incapable of performing the services  required
          to be performed by you under the terms of this  Agreement for a period
          of at least  sixty  (60)  consecutive  days,  or for  sixty  (60) days
          (whether consecutive or not) during any six-month period.

               (2) Farmer  Mac may  terminate  your  employment  effective  upon
          notice  to you at any  time  for  "cause."  For the  purposes  of this
          subsection,  "cause"  will mean  only:  (A) your  willful  failure  to
          perform  substantially  your  duties  hereunder,  other  than any such
          failure  resulting  from your  incapacity  due to  physical  or mental
          illness;  or (B) your willful engagement in activities contrary to the
          best interests of Farmer Mac. For purposes of this subsection, no act,
          or failure to act on your part,  shall be considered  "willful" unless
          done,  or  omitted to be done,  by you not in good  faith and  without
          reasonable  belief  that  your  action  or  omission  was in the  best
          interests of Farmer Mac.

               (3) Farmer Mac may terminate your  employment  without "cause" at
          any time. Such termination shall become effective June 1, 2007.

               (4)  Notwithstanding  the provisions of subsection 7(a)(3) above,
          Farmer Mac may terminate your employment at any time after the passage
          by the Board of Directors  of Farmer Mac of a  resolution  authorizing
          the  dissolution of Farmer Mac. Such  termination  of your  employment
          shall become effective on the later of twelve (12) months after notice
          of termination or the date that such dissolution of Farmer Mac becomes
          final as a matter  of law,  provided,  however,  that  neither  of the
          following shall be deemed to be a dissolution for the purposes of this
          Agreement:  (i)  dissolution  of Farmer Mac which  becomes  final as a
          matter of law more than  twelve  (12)  months  after  adoption  of the
          resolution of  dissolution;  or (ii)  incorporation,  organization  or
          reorganization  of a  corporation  or other  business  entity which is
          substantially  similar to Farmer Mac and which uses  substantially the
          same assets or equity as Farmer Mac,  within  twelve (12) months after
          adoption of the resolution of  dissolution.  As used herein,  the term
          "reorganization"  shall have the same meaning as in Section  368(a) of
          the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

         (b) Payment of Accrued Compensation.

               (1) Upon  termination  of this  Agreement  pursuant to  preceding
          subsection (a), you (or your estate or heirs, as the case may be) will
          be  entitled  to  receive  all Base  Salary,  Incentive  Compensation,
          expense reimbursements,  vacation pay, and similar amounts accrued and
          unpaid as of the date of such  termination.  The obligations of Farmer
          Mac under this  subsection  (b) will survive any  termination  of this
          Agreement.

               (2) In the  event of your  voluntary  termination  of  employment
          hereunder,  Farmer  Mac will  not be  obligated  to make  any  further
          compensation  payments  to  you  beyond  those  accrued  prior  to the
          effective date of such termination.

     (c) Disability  Pay. Upon  termination  of this  Agreement  pursuant to the
preceding subsection (a)(1), Farmer Mac, in its discretion, will either:

               (1) continue to pay you (or your estate or heirs, as the case may
          be) for the  lesser  of two (2) years or the  balance  of the Term the
          difference  between  your  current  Base  Salary  and  the  amount  of
          disability insurance payments received by you under insurance policies
          provided by Farmer Mac in accordance with this Agreement; or

               (2) pay you (or your  estate  or  heirs,  as the case may be) the
          present  value  of the  payments  described  in  preceding  subsection
          (c)(1),  discounted  at a rate equal to the yield then  available  for
          two-year U.S. Treasury Notes, plus 50 basis points (0.50%).

     (d) Severance Pay. Upon termination of this Agreement pursuant to preceding
subsection  7(a)(3) or 7(a)(4),  Farmer Mac will pay you within thirty (30) days
after such  termination an aggregate amount in cash equal to one hundred percent
(100%)  of all Base  Salary  scheduled  to be paid and not yet paid to you under
this Agreement for the balance of the Term.

             In the event of Farmer Mac's severance of your employment pursuant
   to preceding subsection 7(a)(1), (3), or (4), the amount to be paid by Farmer
   Mac to you hereunder will not be mitigated by any subsequent earnings by you
   from any source.

     (e) Constructive Termination.  You may, at your option, deem this Agreement
to have been  terminated  by Farmer  Mac in the event of its  breach,  including
prospective  breach,  of any term hereof  unremedied  for thirty (30) days after
notice thereof to Farmer Mac. Upon notice to Farmer Mac of your exercise of this
option,  you will have the same rights under such a constructive  termination as
if Farmer Mac had terminated  your employment  pursuant to preceding  subsection
(a)(3).

      8. Agreement Not to Compete with Farmer Mac.

     Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event of
the termination of your employment,  for a period of two years  thereafter,  you
shall  not,  without  the prior  written  consent  of Farmer  Mac,  directly  or
indirectly,  engage in any business or activity,  whether as  principal,  agent,
officer,  director,  partner,  employee,  independent  contractor,   consultant,
stockholder or otherwise,  alone or in association with any other person,  firm,
corporation or other business organization, that directly or indirectly competes
with any of the  businesses  of  Farmer  Mac in any  manner,  including  without
limitation,  the  acquisition  and  securitization  (for capital market sale) of
agricultural mortgage loans or USDA "guaranteed portions"  (hereinafter referred
to as "Farmer Mac Qualified  Loans");  provided,  however,  that such prohibited
activity  shall not include the  ownership of up to 20% of the common stock in a
public company.

   9. Agreement Not to Use Confidential or Proprietary Information.

     Farmer Mac and you both recognize that you have access to and acquire,  and
may assist in developing,  confidential and proprietary  information relating to
the  business and  operations  of Farmer Mac as a result of your  employment  or
association  with Farmer Mac. You hereby covenant and agree that you will retain
all "Confidential  Information" (as defined below) in trust for the sole benefit
of Farmer Mac and its successors and assigns.  You hereby covenant further that,
in addition  to your  fiduciary  responsibilities  as an officer not to disclose
certain  information  of or relating  to Farmer  Mac,  you will not, at any time
during or after the term of this Agreement, without the prior written consent of
Farmer Mac, directly or indirectly  communicate or divulge any such Confidential
Information to any person, firm, corporation or other business organization,  or
use any such Confidential Information for your own account or for the account of
any other person,  except as required in connection with the performance of your
services  hereunder.  The term  "Confidential  Information" shall mean any trade
secret,  data or other  confidential or proprietary  information  related to the
business  and   activities  of  Farmer  Mac.   Notwithstanding   the  foregoing,
Confidential  Information shall not include any information that is or becomes a
part of the public  domain or  generally  available  to the public  (unless such
availability  occurs as a result of any breach by you of this  Section  11),  or
becomes available to you on a  non-confidential  basis from a source (other than
Farmer Mac) that is not bound by a confidentiality agreement and does not breach
his or her fiduciary  responsibilities.  The  provisions of this Section 9 shall
survive the termination of this Agreement and the termination of your employment
hereunder.

   10. Agreement Not to Solicit Farmer Mac Employees.

     For a  period  of two  years  after  the  termination  of  your  employment
hereunder, you shall not, directly or indirectly,  induce any employee of Farmer
Mac who is a "member of management"  (as defined below) or is directly  involved
in the  acquisition and  securitization  (for capital market sale) of Farmer Mac
Qualified  Loans to engage in any  activity  in which  you are  prohibited  from
engaging in under this Agreement,  or to terminate such person's employment with
Farmer Mac.  You shall not directly or  indirectly,  either  individually  or as
owner, agent,  employee,  consultant or otherwise,  employ, offer employment to,
lure,  entice away or assist others in recruiting or hiring any person who is or
was  employed by Farmer Mac unless such person  shall have ceased to be employed
by Farmer  Mac for a period of at least six  months  and is not  subject  to any
non-compete  covenants  substantially  similar in nature to those  contained  in
Section  8  hereof.  "Member  of  management"  means  the  President,  any  Vice
President,  the  Controller of Farmer Mac or attorney or paralegal in the employ
of Farmer Mac.

     11. Notices. Any notice given under this Agreement will be sufficient if in
writing and either:  (a) mailed postage prepaid by registered or certified mail,
return  receipt  requested;  or (b)  delivered by hand to, in the case of Farmer
Mac, 919 18th Street, N.W.,  Washington,  D.C. 20006, attention President or, in
the case of the Employee,  18505 Rolling Acres Way,  Olney, MD 20832 (or to such
other  addresses  as may be from  time to time  designated  by  notice  from the
recipient  party to the other).  Any such notice will be  effective  upon actual
receipt or refusal thereof.

     12. Miscellaneous.

          (a) Governing Law. This Agreement will be governed by, and interpreted
     and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the District of Columbia.

          (b) Waiver.  The waiver by any party of a breach of any  provision  of
     this  Agreement  will not  operate  as a waiver of any other  breach of any
     provision of this Agreement by any party.

          (c)  Entire   Agreement.   This   Agreement   sets  forth  the  entire
     understanding of the parties  concerning the subject matter hereof, and may
     not be changed or modified except by a written  instrument duly executed by
     or on behalf of the parties hereto.

          (d) Successors  and Assigns.  This Agreement will inure to the benefit
     of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective  successors,
     heirs,  personal  representatives and assigns. This subsection is not to be
     construed to permit you to assign your  obligation to perform the duties of
     your employment hereunder.  This subsection permits Farmer Mac the right to
     assign this Agreement to a successor entity.

          (e)  Severability.  If any  term,  condition,  or  provision  of  this
     Agreement or the application thereof to any party or circumstances will, at
     any time or to any extent be invalid or  unenforceable,  the  remainder  of
     this Agreement,  or the application of such term, condition or provision to
     parties or  circumstances  other than those to which it is held  invalid or
     unenforceable,  will not be affected thereby,  and each term, condition and
     provision of this  Agreement  will be valid and  enforceable to the fullest
     extent permitted by law.

          (f) Action by Farmer Mac.  Except as expressly  provided  otherwise in
     this Agreement, reference to actions, decisions,  determinations or similar
     occurrences  by Farmer Mac (other than the execution of this  Agreement and
     any modifications  hereto or notices given hereunder) will mean the action,
     decision or  determination  of the Board of Directors  or the  President of

     were made,  not  misleading  with  respect  to the  period  covered by this
     report;
3.   Based on my  knowledge,  the  financial  statements,  and  other  financial

     in Exchange Act Rules  13a-15(e) and  15d-15(e))  for the registrant and we
     have:
          a)   designed such disclosure controls and procedures,  or caused such
               disclosure  controls  and  procedures  to be  designed  under our
               supervision,  to ensure that material information relating to the
               registrant,  including  its  consolidated  subsidiaries,  is made
               known to us by others within those entities,  particularly during
               the period in which this quarterly report is being prepared;

               and  procedures,  as of the  end of the  period  covered  by this
               report based on such evaluation; and
          c)   disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's  internal
               control  over  financial   reporting  that  occurred  during  the
               registrant's most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's  fourth
               fiscal  quarter  in  the  case  of an  annual  report)  that  has
               materially  affected,  or  is  reasonably  likely  to  materially
               affect,   the   registrant's   internal  control  over  financial
               reporting; and
5.   The registrant's  other certifying  officer and I have disclosed,  based on
     our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to
     the registrant's  auditors and the audit committee of registrant's board of
     directors (or persons performing the equivalent function):
          a)   all  significant  deficiencies  and  material  weaknesses  in the
               design or operation of internal control over financial  reporting
               which are reasonably  likely to adversely affect the registrant's
               ability  to  record,  process,  summarize  and  report  financial
               information; and
          b)   any fraud,  whether or not material,  that involves management or
               other employees who have a significant  role in the  registrant's
               internal control over financial reporting.
