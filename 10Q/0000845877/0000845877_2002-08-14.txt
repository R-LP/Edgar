Item 1. Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

     The following interim condensed  consolidated  financial  statements of the
Federal  Agricultural  Mortgage  Corporation ("Farmer Mac" or the "Corporation")
have been prepared,  without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the
Securities  and Exchange  Commission.  These  condensed  consolidated  financial
statements reflect all normal and recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion
of  management,  necessary  to present a fair  statement  of the results for the
interim periods presented. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally
included in annual  consolidated  financial  statements  have been  condensed or

disclosures are adequate to present fairly the condensed  consolidated financial
position,   condensed   consolidated   results  of   operations   and  condensed
consolidated  cash flows as of the dates and for the  periods  presented.  These
condensed  consolidated  financial statements should be read in conjunction with
the audited 2001 consolidated financial statements of Farmer Mac included in the

             NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1.  Accounting Policies

(a)   Cash and Cash Equivalents

     Farmer Mac considers  highly  liquid  investment  securities  with original
maturities  of  three  months  or less to be cash  equivalents.  Changes  in the
balance of cash and cash equivalents are reported in the Condensed  Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows. The following table sets forth  information  regarding
certain  cash and non-cash  transactions  for the six months ended June 30, 2002
and 2001.

</TABLE>


(b)   Loans

     As of June 30, 2002,  loans held by Farmer Mac included  $24.3 million held
for sale and $812.8 million held for investment.  As of December 31, 2001, loans
held by Farmer Mac included  $25.8 million held for sale and $173.6 million held
for investment.

            (c)  Financial Derivatives

     A  financial  derivative  is a  financial  instrument  that has one or more
underlyings and one or more notional  amounts,  requires no significant  initial
net investment and has terms that require net settlement. Farmer Mac enters into
financial  derivative  contracts  as an end-user for hedging  purposes,  not for
trading or speculative purposes.  The Corporation enters into interest rate swap
contracts  principally to adjust the characteristics of short-term debt to match
more  closely  the cash flow and  duration  characteristics  of its  longer-term
mortgage  assets,  thereby  reducing  interest rate risk,  and also to derive an
overall lower  effective  fixed rate cost of borrowing  than would  otherwise be
available to the Corporation in the conventional debt market.

     When financial derivatives meet the specific hedge criteria of Statement of
Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative  Instruments
and Hedging Activities ("SFAS 133"), they are accounted for as either fair value
hedges or cash flow  hedges.  Financial  derivatives  that do not satisfy  those
hedge criteria are not accounted for as hedges and changes in the fair values of
those financial derivatives are reported in income or expense.

     Net after-tax charges against earnings under SFAS 133 during second quarter
2002 totaled  $149,500,  and the net after-tax  decrease to other  comprehensive
income  totaled  $14.6  million.  Substantially  all of this  amount  represents
changes  in the fair  values  of  forward  sale  contracts,  interest-rate  swap
contracts and settled  forward sale  contracts  using fair values as of June 30,
2002. In  accordance  with SFAS 133,  Farmer Mac estimates  that $503,000 of the
amount  currently  reported in accumulated  other  comprehensive  income will be
reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months.  For the quarter ended
June 30, 2002, the ineffectiveness of designated hedges included in Farmer Mac's
net income was immaterial.

            (d)  Reserve for Losses

     Farmer  Mac  maintains  a reserve  for losses to cover  estimated  probable
losses on loans held and its on- and  off-balance  sheet  guarantees,  including
loans  underlying  Post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Securities  and Long-Term  Standby
Purchase  Commitments  ("LTSPCs").  (See Note 2 for a description of LTSPCs.) In
estimating  probable  losses  on  loans  held  and  on-  and  off-balance  sheet
guarantees,   management   considers   economic   conditions,   geographic   and
agricultural  commodity  concentrations,  the credit  profile of the  portfolio,
delinquency trends and historical charge-off and recovery activity.  The reserve
is  increased  through  periodic  provisions  charged to expense  and reduced by
charge-offs for actual loan losses, net of recoveries.

     No reserve  for losses  has been made for  Farmer Mac I  Securities  issued
prior to the 1996 Act or  securities  issued  under the  Farmer  Mac II  Program
("Farmer Mac II Securities").  Farmer Mac I Securities  issued prior to the 1996
Act are supported by unguaranteed subordinated interests,  which are expected to
exceed the estimated  credit  losses on those  securities.  Guaranteed  Portions
collateralizing  Farmer Mac II  Securities  are  guaranteed by the United States
Department of Agriculture ("USDA").

(e)   Earnings Per Common Share

     Basic earnings per common share are based on the weighted-average number of
common shares  outstanding.  Diluted  earnings per common share are based on the
weighted-average  number of common  shares  outstanding  adjusted to include all
potentially  dilutive common stock. The following schedule  reconciles basic and
diluted  earnings  per common  share for the three and six months ended June 30,
2002 and 2001:

(f)   Preferred Stock

     On May 6, 2002 the  Corporation  issued 700,000 shares of 6.40%  Cumulative
Preferred  Stock,  Series  A,  which  has a  redemption  price  and  liquidation
preference  of $50.00 per share,  plus accrued and unpaid  dividends  ("Series A
Preferred  Stock").  The Series A Preferred Stock does not have a maturity date.
Beginning  on June 30,  2012,  Farmer  Mac has the option to redeem the Series A
Preferred  Stock at any time,  in whole or in part, at the  redemption  price of
$50.00 per share,  plus accrued and unpaid  dividends  through and including the
redemption  date.  Farmer  Mac will pay  cumulative  dividends  on the  Series A
Preferred  Stock  quarterly  in  arrears,  when and if  declared by the Board of
Directors.  The costs of issuing  the Series A Preferred  Stock were  charged to
Additional  Paid-in  Capital.  On June 6, 2002,  Farmer Mac's Board of Directors
declared a dividend of $0.48 per share on the Series A  Preferred  Stock for the
period from May 6, 2002 to June 30, 2002, which was paid on July 1, 2002.

      Certain reclassifications of prior period information were made to conform

            (h)  New Accounting Standards

     In April 2002, the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board ("FASB")  issued
Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  145,  Rescission  of  FASB
Statements  No. 4, 44 and 64,  Amendment of FASB  Statement No. 13 and Technical
Corrections ("SFAS 145"). Effective January 1, 2003, SFAS 145 requires gains and
losses  from  the  extinguishment  or  repurchase  of debt to be  classified  as
extraordinary  items only if they meet the criteria for such  classification  in
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30, Reporting the Results of Operations,
Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business and  Extraordinary,
Unusual and Infrequently  Occurring  Events and  Transactions  ("APB 30"). Until
January 1, 2003, gains and losses from the  extinguishment or repurchase of debt
must be classified as  extraordinary  items.  After January 1, 2003, any gain or
loss resulting from the  extinguishment  or repurchase of debt  classified as an
extraordinary  item in a prior  period that does not meet the  criteria for such
classification under APB 30 must be reclassified.

Note 2.  Off-Balance Sheet Guaranteed Securities

     Farmer Mac issues  off-balance  sheet  guarantees  in the normal  course of
business  to  fulfill  its  statutory   mission  of  increasing   liquidity  for
agricultural  and rural  residential  mortgage  lenders.  Farmer  Mac offers two
alternatives to lenders who seek the benefits of Farmer Mac's guarantee  without
selling  loans to Farmer Mac through the cash  window--"swap"  transactions  and
LTSPCs. In a swap transaction, Farmer Mac acquires Qualified Loans from approved
lenders  ("Sellers") in exchange for Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities backed by
such Qualified Loans. In consideration for Farmer Mac's assumption of the credit
risk on loans underlying a swap,  Farmer Mac receives an annual guarantee fee on
the  outstanding  balance of the Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities.  Unlike cash
window  transactions,  which  generally  involve  loans with terms  specified by
Farmer Mac in advance,  swap transactions usually are negotiated with the Seller
and may involve loans with payment,  maturity and interest rate  characteristics
that differ  from those of Farmer  Mac's cash window  purchases.  Regardless  of
variances  in loan terms from the cash  window  products,  Qualified  Loans must
conform to Farmer Mac's credit and  appraisal  standards to be eligible for swap
transactions.

     Farmer Mac's variant of a swap  transaction,  the LTSPC, is available for a
Seller seeking to obtain all of the benefits of a swap  transaction  (other than
the  replacement of loans with securities on the Seller's books) while retaining
title to the  Qualified  Loans.  An LTSPC  permits a Seller to nominate from its
portfolio a segregated  pool of Qualified Loans in its portfolio to transfer the
credit risk on those loans to Farmer  Mac.  To be eligible  and  included in the
LTSPC  pool,  those  Qualified  Loans must  conform to Farmer  Mac's  credit and
appraisal  standards and be approved by Farmer Mac.  Under an LTSPC,  Farmer Mac
commits  to  purchase  any  Qualified  Loan in that  pool of loans  if:  (a) the
Qualified Loan becomes four months  delinquent;  or (b) the Qualified Loan meets
Farmer Mac's loan  purchase  requirements  at the time the Seller  requests that
Farmer  Mac  purchase  the loan.  In the case of a  Qualified  Loan that is four
months delinquent,  Farmer Mac will pay the Seller a predetermined price for the
loan--generally,  principal  plus accrued  interest  (the payment of the accrued
interest being delayed until the delinquent  Qualified Loan is  liquidated).  In
the case of a Qualified Loan under clause (b), the price would be a market-based
value negotiated at the time of purchase.  This structure  permits the Seller to
retain the  segregated  loans in its  portfolio  while  reducing  its credit and
concentration exposures and, consequently,  its regulatory capital requirements.
In  consideration  for  Farmer  Mac's  assumption  of  the  credit  risk  on the
segregated  loans,  the  Seller  pays  annual  fees to  Farmer  Mac based on the
outstanding  balance of the loans at a level  approximating what would have been
Farmer Mac's  guarantee  fee had the loans been  exchanged  with Farmer Mac in a
swap transaction.  The credit risk to Farmer Mac related to an LTSPC is the same
as that of a swap transaction or Farmer Mac Guaranteed Security.

     The  following  table  presents  the  balance  of  outstanding  LTSPCs  and
off-balance  sheet  Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities  as of June 30,  2002 and
December 31, 2001:

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
        Results of Operations


Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

     Certain statements made in this Form 10-Q are "forward-looking  statements"
within  the  meaning of the  Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform Act of 1995
pertaining  to  management's  current  expectations  as to Farmer  Mac's  future
financial results, business prospects and business developments. Forward-looking
statements  include,  without  limitation,   any  statement  that  may  predict,
forecast,  indicate or imply future results,  performance or  achievements,  and
typically are accompanied by, and identified with, such terms as  "anticipates,"
"believes,"  "expects,"  "intends," "should" and similar phrases.  The following
management's  discussion  and  analysis  includes   forward-looking   statements
addressing  Farmer Mac's  prospects  for  earnings and growth in loan  purchase,
guarantee and securitization volume; trends in net interest income and provision
for  losses;  changes in capital  position;  and other  business  and  financial
matters.

     Management's  expectations  for Farmer Mac's future  necessarily  involve a
number of assumptions,  estimates and the evaluation of risks and uncertainties.
Various  factors  could cause Farmer  Mac's  actual  results or events to differ
materially from the expectations as expressed or implied by the  forward-looking
statements,  including:  uncertainties  regarding  the  rate  and  direction  of
development  of the  secondary  market  for  agricultural  mortgage  loans;  the
possible  establishment  of  additional  statutory  or  regulatory  restrictions
applicable  to Farmer  Mac,  such as  restrictions  on Farmer  Mac's  investment
authority;  substantial  changes in interest  rates,  agricultural  land values,
commodity prices,  export demand for U.S.  agricultural products and the general
economy;  protracted  adverse  weather,  market  or other  conditions  affecting
particular geographic regions or particular  commodities related to agricultural
mortgage  loans  backing  Farmer  Mac  Guaranteed  Securities;   legislative  or
regulatory  developments or  interpretations  of Farmer Mac's statutory  charter
that could  adversely  affect  Farmer Mac or the  ability of certain  lenders to
participate in its programs or the terms of any such participation; Farmer Mac's
continuing access to the debt markets at favorable rates and terms; the possible
effect  of  the  risk-based  capital  requirement  which  could,  under  certain
circumstances,   be  in  excess  of  the  statutory  minimum  capital  level;  a
continuation  of  inaccurate  and  misleading  publicity  about  Farmer Mac; the
outcome of the pending  review of Farmer Mac by the General  Accounting  Office;
the  rate of  growth  in  agricultural  mortgage  indebtedness;  the size of the
agricultural mortgage market;  borrower preferences for fixed-rate  agricultural
mortgage indebtedness;  the willingness of lenders to sell agricultural mortgage
loans into the Farmer Mac  secondary  market;  the  willingness  of investors to
invest  in   agricultural   mortgage-backed   securities;   competition  in  the
origination  or  purchase  of  agricultural  mortgage  loans  and  the  sale  of
agricultural   mortgage-backed   and  debt   securities;   the  effects  on  the
agricultural  economy of the  government  payments  that are provided for in the
Farm Bill signed into law May 13,  2002;  or changes in Farmer Mac's status as a
government-sponsored enterprise.

     The foregoing factors are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report may
include additional factors that could adversely affect Farmer Mac's business and
its financial  performance.  Furthermore,  new risk factors  emerge from time to
time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor
assess the  effects of such  factors on Farmer  Mac's  business or the extent to
which any factor, or combination of factors,  may cause actual results to differ
materially  from the  expectations  expressed or implied by the  forward-looking
statements.  In light of  these  potential  risks  and  uncertainties,  no undue
reliance should be placed on any  forward-looking  statements  expressed in this
report. Furthermore, Farmer Mac undertakes no obligation to release publicly the
results  of  revisions  to any  forward-looking  statements  that may be made to
reflect any future events or circumstances  except as otherwise  mandated by the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

     The  preparation  of our  financial  results of  operations  and  financial
position  require us to make estimates and  assumptions  that affect the amounts
reported in these condensed  consolidated financial statements and related notes
for the periods  presented,  and actual results could differ from our estimates.
The critical  accounting  policy that is both  important to the portrayal of our
financial condition and requires complex, subjective judgments is the accounting
policy for Farmer Mac's reserve for losses.

     The  purpose of the  reserve  for losses is to provide  for losses that are
probable  to have  occurred as of the  balance  sheet  date,  and not to predict
future losses in the loan portfolio. The determination of the reserve for losses
requires management to make significant estimates based on information available
as of the  balance  sheet date,  including  the amounts and timing of losses and
current market and economic conditions. These estimates are subject to change in
future reporting periods if such conditions and information change. For example,
a continued decline in the national or agricultural economies could result in an
increase in delinquencies or foreclosures,  resulting in the need for additional
reserves for losses in future periods.

     Farmer  Mac  maintains  a reserve  for losses to cover  estimated  probable
losses on loans held and its on- and  off-balance  sheet  guarantees,  including
loans underlying Post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Securities and LTSPCs. In estimating
probable  losses  on  loans  held  and on-  and  off-balance  sheet  guarantees,
management considers economic conditions,  geographic and agricultural commodity
concentrations,  the credit  profile of the  portfolio,  delinquency  trends and
historical  charge-off and recovery  activity.  The reserve is increased through
periodic  provisions  charged to expense and reduced by  charge-offs  for actual
loan losses, net of recoveries.

     No reserve  for losses  has been made for  Farmer Mac I  Securities  issued
prior to the 1996 Act or  Farmer  Mac II  Securities.  Farmer  Mac I  Securities
issued  prior  to the  1996  Act  are  supported  by  unguaranteed  subordinated
interests,  which are expected to exceed the  estimated  credit  losses on those
securities.  Guaranteed  Portions  collateralizing  Farmer Mac II Securities are
guaranteed by the USDA.

     Further  information  regarding  loss  reserves  is  included  in  "-  Risk
Management - Credit Risk."

Results of Operations

     Operating  Results.  SFAS 133  requires  the  change in the fair  values of
certain financial derivatives to be reflected in the Corporation's net income or
other  comprehensive  income.  Management  believes  that  reporting  results by
reference to operating income and operating  revenues,  excluding the cumulative
effect of the  change in  accounting  principles  recognized  on January 1, 2001
under SFAS 133 and its ongoing  effects during the reporting  periods,  provides
meaningful  operating  measures  of Farmer  Mac's  financial  performance.  Such
information  is presented to  supplement,  not replace,  net income,  net income
available to common  stockholders,  revenues,  cash from operations or any other
operating or liquidity  performance measures prescribed by accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States.

     Overview.  Net income  available to common  stockholders for second quarter
2002,  including  the  cumulative  and  ongoing  effects  of  SFAS  133  and the
extraordinary gain on debt extinguishment, was $6.3 million or $0.52 per diluted
common share.  Net income for second  quarter 2001 was $3.7 million or $0.32 per
diluted share. Operating income,  excluding the extraordinary gain, totaled $5.8
million for second quarter 2002, or $0.48 per diluted common share,  compared to
$3.7 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, for second quarter 2001.

     Farmer Mac's revenue growth  continued in second  quarter 2002,  reflecting
the effects of  outstanding  guarantee  volume as of June 30, 2002 that was more
than $1.4 billion  higher than at the close of second quarter 2001 and increased
net  interest   income  due  to  a  higher   average  net   interest   yield  on
interest-earning  assets.  During second quarter 2002, Farmer Mac: (1) purchased
$57.8  million of  Guaranteed  Portions  of loans  guaranteed  by the USDA;  (2)
purchased  $551.7 million of Farmer Mac I loans; and (3) added $280.9 million in
LTSPCs.

     USDA is forecasting  net cash income on farms for 2002 to be $51.1 billion,
which includes  government  payments of $21.7 billion. In 2001, $21.4 billion in
government  payments were made to the agricultural sector and net cash income on
farms for 2001 was $59.0 billion. USDA currently expects farm real estate values
to rise during 2002 by about 3 percent.  Regionally, farm real estate values may
vary  with  differing  rates  of  increase,  or  even  decrease,   depending  on
commodities grown and regional economic factors.

     Set forth below is a more  detailed  discussion  of Farmer Mac's results of
operations.

      Net Interest Income.

     Net  interest  income was $8.9  million for second  quarter  2002 and $16.4
million  year-to-date,  compared to $6.4 million and $11.9  million for the same
periods in 2001. The net interest yield,  which does not include  guarantee fees
for loans  purchased  prior to April 1, 2001 (the effective date of Statement of
Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing
of Financial Assets and  Extinguishments  of Liabilities  ("SFAS 140")),  was 91
basis points for year-to-date 2002, compared to 74 basis points for year-to-date
2001.  The net  interest  yields for  year-to-date  2002 and  year-to-date  2001
included the benefits of yield  maintenance  payments of 7 basis points and zero
basis points, respectively.  The income realized from yield maintenance payments
is, in effect,  the  accelerated  present  value of an  expected  future  income
stream,  which, in turn, leads to slightly reduced net interest income in future
reporting periods.  The timing and size of these payments varies greatly and, as
such,  variations  should not be  considered  indicative of positive or negative
trends to gauge future financial results. The effect of the adoption of SFAS 140
was a  reclassification  of  approximately  $0.7  million  (7 basis  points)  of
guarantee fee income as interest income for the year-to-date 2002.  Adjusted for
the effects of yield  maintenance and excluding the effects of SFAS 140, the net
interest yields for year-to-date 2002 and year-to-date 2001 were 77 basis points
and 74 basis points, respectively.

     The following table provides information regarding the average balances and
rates of  interest-earning  assets and funding for the six months ended June 30,
2002 and 2001.

     The following table sets forth certain information regarding the changes in
the  components of Farmer Mac's net interest  income for the periods  indicated.
For each category, information is provided on changes attributable to changes in
volume (change in volume  multiplied by old rate) and changes in rate (change in
rate  multiplied  by old  volume).  Combined  rate/volume  variances,  the third
element of the calculation, are allocated based on their relative size.

     Other Income.  Other income, which is comprised of guarantee fee income and
miscellaneous  income,  totaled $5.1 million for second quarter 2002 compared to
$3.8  million for the same  period in 2001.  Guarantee  fee income,  the largest
component of other income, was $4.7 million for second quarter 2002, compared to
$3.7 million for second  quarter  2001.  The relative  increase in guarantee fee
income  reflects an increase in the average  balance of outstanding  guarantees.
Excluding the effects of the adoption of SFAS 140 that reclassified $0.7 million
of guarantee fee income as interest  income,  guarantee  fees for second quarter
2002 would have been $5.4 million.  The difference or "spread"  between the cost
of Farmer  Mac's debt funding for loans and AMBS held on its books and the yield
on those assets is composed of one component that  compensates  for credit risk,
which would  continue  to be  received  by Farmer Mac as a guarantee  fee if the
assets were sold and another  component that compensates for interest rate risk,
which would not  typically  continue to be received by Farmer  Mac(except to the
extent attributable to a retained  interest-only  strip) if the asset were sold.
Miscellaneous  income was $368,000 for second quarter 2002, compared to $116,000
for second quarter 2001.

     Expenses.  During second  quarter  2002,  operating  expenses  totaled $3.0
million,  compared to $2.8  million for second  quarter  2001.  The  increase in
operating  expenses in second  quarter  2002  primarily  reflects an increase in
legal and consulting  fees.  Farmer Mac expects that legal and  consulting  fees
will  continue at an  increased  level  approximately  $300,000 to $400,000  per
quarter  above the prior  level  until the  effects  of certain  inaccurate  and
misleading publicity about Farmer Mac have dissipated, which we believe will not
occur until  sometime  after the GAO  completes  and  releases its report of its
review  of  Farmer  Mac.  At this  time,  we are not  certain  when the GAO will
complete or release its report.  Operating expenses as a percentage of operating
revenues  were 22 percent for second  quarter  2002,  compared to 28 percent for
second quarter 2001.

     Farmer Mac's provision for losses was $2.0 million for second quarter 2002,
compared  to $1.4  million  for the same  period in 2001.  As of June 30,  2002,
Farmer  Mac's  reserve for losses  totaled  $18.3  million,  or 0.41  percent of
outstanding  Post-1996  Act loans  and AMBS,  compared  to $15.9  million  (0.45
percent) and $13.2 million  (0.43  percent) as of December 31, 2001 and June 30,
2001, respectively.

     The provision for income taxes totaled $2.6 million for second quarter 2002
compared to $2.1 million for the same period in 2001. Farmer Mac's effective tax
rate for second  quarter  2002 was 30.1  percent,  compared to 35.5  percent for
2001.  The  reduction in the  effective tax rate reflects the effects of certain
tax-advantaged investment securities.

     Extraordinary Gain. During second quarter 2002, Farmer Mac recognized a net
after-tax  extraordinary  gain of $0.6 million  resulting from the repurchase of
$18.9 million of outstanding  Farmer Mac debt.  Farmer Mac  repurchases  debt as
market opportunities arise as part of its interest rate risk management program.

     Business  Volume.  The  following  table  sets  forth  the  amount of loans
purchased or guaranteed, and AMBS issued during the periods indicated:

     See  "Overview"  above  for a  discussion  regarding  loans  purchased  and
guaranteed by Farmer Mac.

     Indicators of future loan purchase and guarantee  volume (but not of LTSPC,
swap or bulk purchase  volume) in the immediately  succeeding  reporting  period
include outstanding commitments to purchase loans and the total balance of loans
submitted  for  approval  or  approved  but not  yet  purchased.  Many  purchase
commitments entered into by Farmer Mac are mandatory delivery commitments.  If a
seller  obtains a  mandatory  commitment  and is unable to deliver  the loans as
required  thereunder,  Farmer  Mac  requires  the seller to pay a fee to modify,
extend or cancel the commitment. As of June 30, 2002, outstanding commitments to
purchase Farmer Mac I loans totaled $15.6 million,  compared to $15.9 million as
of June 30, 2001. Of the total Farmer Mac I commitments  outstanding  as of June
30, 2002 and 2001, $10.6 million and $10.0 million, respectively, were mandatory
commitments.  Loans  submitted for approval or approved but not yet committed to
purchase  totaled $86.1 million as of June 30, 2002,  compared to $160.0 million
as of June 30, 2001.  Not all of these loans are  purchased,  as some are denied
for credit reasons or withdrawn by the seller.

     While significant progress has been made in developing the secondary market
for  agricultural  mortgages,  Farmer Mac  continues to face the  challenges  of
establishing a market where none previously existed. The events of recent months
have begun to have a dampening  effect on Farmer Mac's  business  prospects over
the near term, which the Corporation expects will be ameliorated by the issuance
of the GAO  report  and other  actions  Farmer  Mac is  taking  to  ensure  that
Congress,  agricultural  lenders and other interested  parties understand better
the integrity, safety and soundness of Farmer Mac.

Balance Sheet Review

     During the six month period ended June 30, 2002,  total assets increased by
$620.4  million,  with  increases  in  program  assets  (Farmer  Mac  guaranteed
securities  and loans) of $602.7 million which are  attributable  to a bulk loan
purchase in April 2002 of $489.3  million and other  Farmer Mac I and Farmer Mac
II purchases.  For further information  regarding both on- and off-balance sheet
guaranteed  securities,  see "Supplemental  Information"  below.  Similar to the
increase in total  assets  during the period,  total  liabilities  increased  by
$569.8 million from December 31, 2001 to June 30, 2002.

     Average  return on common  equity,  excluding  the effects of  Statement of
Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 115,  Accounting for Certain Investments in
Debt and  Equity  Securities,  SFAS  133 and the  extraordinary  gain,  was 16.9
percent for second  quarter  2002,  compared to 13.8 percent for second  quarter
2001.

     As of June 30,  2002,  Farmer Mac's core capital  totaled  $176.2  million,
compared to $126.0  million as of December  31, 2001.  As of June 30, 2002,  the
actual core capital  balance  exceeded  Farmer Mac's  statutory  minimum capital
requirement by approximately $45.8 million.

     The FCA issued its final  risk-based  capital  regulation for Farmer Mac on
April 12, 2001 and the Corporation  was required to meet the risk-based  capital
standards  beginning on May 23,  2002.  We have  maintained a dialogue  with FCA
regarding the application of the regulation and the complex underlying  economic
model.  Farmer Mac is in compliance with the risk-based  capital standards under
the  regulation,  and we are  confident  that Farmer Mac will  continue to be in
compliance.

     The first application after the effective compliance date of the definitive
risk-based  capital stress test  promulgated by the FCA ("RBC test") showed that
Farmer Mac's actual  regulatory  capital of $194.5 million was $114.4 million in
excess of the $80.1 million risk-based capital  requirement as of June 30, 2002.
That  RBC   requirement  was  also  $50.3  million  below  the  minimum  capital
requirement  of  $130.4  million.  The  relevant  measure  for the  RBC  test is
regulatory capital,  which under the regulatory methodology is core capital plus
loss reserves. Although the RBC test results show capital requirements below the
statutory  minimum,  Farmer Mac is required to hold the higher of the  statutory
minimum capital requirement or the amount required to pass the RBC test.

Risk Management

     Interest-Rate  Risk.  Farmer Mac is subject  to  interest-rate  risk on all
assets held for investment  because of possible  timing  differences in the cash
flows of the assets and related  liabilities.  This risk is primarily related to
Farmer Mac I and II  Securities  because of the ability of  borrowers  to prepay
their mortgages before the scheduled maturities,  thereby increasing the risk of
asset and liability  cash flow  mismatches.  Cash flow  mismatches in a changing
rate  environment  can reduce the value or earnings of the Corporation if assets
repay sooner than  expected and the  resulting  cash flows must be reinvested in
lower-yielding   investments   when  Farmer  Mac's   funding   costs  cannot  be
correspondingly  reduced,  or if assets repay more slowly than  expected and the
associated  debt  must  be  replaced  by  higher-cost  debt.  Yield  maintenance
provisions  associated with many of the loans underlying Farmer Mac I Securities
reduce,  but do not eliminate,  this risk. Yield maintenance  provisions require
borrowers to make an  additional  payment  when they prepay  their  loans.  When
reinvested with the prepaid principal,  this payment generates substantially the
same cash flows that would have been generated had the loan not prepaid. None of
the loans underlying Farmer Mac II Securities have yield maintenance provisions,
although some carry fixed or declining percentage prepayment penalties.

     Farmer Mac's primary  strategy for managing  interest-rate  risk related to
Farmer Mac I and II Securities  and other assets held for  investment is to fund
them with liabilities that have similar durations, or average cash flow patterns
over time, and provide  flexibility to accommodate  changing prepayment rates in
changing  interest rate  environments.  To achieve the desired funding objective
for Farmer Mac's current  portfolio of fixed rate and  adjustable  rate mortgage
assets,  Farmer  Mac  uses a mix of  short-term  Discount  Notes,  callable  and
non-callable fixed rate Medium-Term Notes and short-term  Discount Notes swapped
to callable and  non-callable  fixed rates.  By using a mix of liabilities  that
includes callable debt, the duration of the liabilities will tend to increase or
decrease as interest rates change in a manner similar to changes in the duration
of the assets.

     Cash and cash  equivalents  mature within three months and are match-funded
with discount notes having similar  maturities.  Investment  securities  consist
predominantly of floating rate securities that reprice within one year. Floating
rate  investments  are funded using a series of discount  note  issuances.  Each
successive Discount Note issuance matures on the corresponding repricing date of
the related investment.

     Farmer Mac is also subject to interest-rate risk on loans,  including loans
that Farmer Mac has committed to acquire, but not yet purchased. When Farmer Mac
commits to  purchase a  Qualified  Loan,  it is  exposed to  interest-rate  risk
between  the time it commits to  purchase  the loan and the time it either:  (a)
sells  AMBS  backed by the loan,  or (b)  issues  debt to retain the loan in its
portfolio  (although  issuing debt to fund the loans as an  investment  does not
fully mitigate  interest-rate risk due to the possible timing differences in the
cash flows of the assets and related  liabilities,  as discussed above).  Farmer
Mac manages the  interest-rate  risk  related to such loans,  and the AMBS to be
issued or debt to be issued to fund the loans as retained  investments,  through
the use of forward sale contracts on the debt and mortgage-backed  securities of
other government-sponsored  enterprises ("GSEs") and futures contracts involving
U.S. Treasury  securities.  Farmer Mac uses GSE forward sale contracts to reduce
Farmer Mac's  interest-rate  exposure to changes in both Treasury rates and AMBS
and debt spreads.

     One method Farmer Mac uses to monitor its exposure to interest-rate risk is
to measure the  sensitivity  of its market value of equity  ("MVE") to shifts of
the U.S. Treasury yield curve. MVE reflects the present value of all future cash
flows  from  on-  and  off-balance  sheet  assets,   liabilities  and  financial
derivatives  marked to market at current interest rates. The following  schedule
summarizes the results of Farmer Mac's MVE  sensitivity  analysis as of June 30,
2002 and December 31, 2001 to an immediate and  instantaneous  parallel shift of
the yield curve.

           - 300 bp                N/A*            -16.2%

 *    As of June 30,  2002,  a -300 bp parallel  shift of the
      U.S.  Treasury yield curve produced  negative  interest
      rates for maturies of 2 years and shorter.

</TABLE>

     MVE analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of Farmer Mac's  asset-liability
match over the life of its assets and liabilities on a present value basis.

     Net Interest Income ("NII") sensitivity, a shorter-term measure of interest
rate risk,  demonstrates a similar lack of exposure to interest rate  movements.
As of June 30, 2002,  an upward  parallel  shift of the yield curve of 100 basis
points would increase twelve-month NII by 9.4 percent, while a downward parallel
shift of 100 basis points would decrease twelve-month NII by 8.6 percent. Farmer
Mac  also  measures  the  sensitivity  of  both  MVE  and  NII to a  variety  of
non-parallel  interest rate shocks,  including  steepening and flattening of the
yield curve.  Farmer Mac's MVE and NII have been  consistently less sensitive to
these non-parallel shocks than to the parallel shocks of the yield curve. Farmer
Mac's effective duration gap, a static measure of interest-rate  risk, was minus
2.9 months as of June 30, 2002,  indicating that Farmer Mac has less sensitivity
to increases in interest rates than to decreases in interest rates.

     The economic  effects of derivatives,  including  interest rate swaps,  are
included  in the MVE  analyses.  Farmer Mac enters into  contracts  in which the
Corporation pays fixed rates of interest and receives floating rates of interest
from counterparties.  These "floating-to-fixed  interest rate swaps" are used to
adjust the  characteristics  of  short-term  debt to match more closely the cash
flow and duration  characteristics  of longer-term reset and fixed rate mortgage
assets, thereby reducing interest rate risk, and also to derive an overall lower
effective  fixed rate cost of borrowing than would otherwise be available in the
conventional  debt market.  As of June 30, 2002,  Farmer Mac had $675.1  million
notional amount of floating-to-fixed  interest rate swaps for terms ranging from
2 to 15 years.

     Farmer Mac uses derivative instruments as an end-user for hedging purposes,
not for trading or speculative  purposes.  When financial  derivatives  meet the
specific hedge criteria of SFAS 133, they are accounted for as either fair value
hedges or cash flow  hedges.  Financial  derivatives  that do not satisfy  those
hedge criteria are not accounted for as hedges and changes in the fair values of
those financial derivatives are reported in income or expense.

     All of Farmer Mac's derivative transactions are conducted through standard,
collateralized  agreements that limit Farmer Mac's potential  credit exposure to
any counterparty.  As of June 30, 2002, Farmer Mac had no  uncollateralized  net
exposure to any counterparty.

     Credit Risk. The outstanding  principal  balance of loans held,  LTSPCs and
loans  underlying  Farmer  Mac  Guaranteed  Securities  as of June 30,  2002 and
December 31, 2001 is summarized in the table below.

     Farmer  Mac  maintains  a reserve  for losses to cover  estimated  probable
losses on loans held and its on- and  off-balance  sheet  guarantees,  including
loans underlying Post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Securities and LTSPCs. In estimating
probable  losses  on  loans  held  and on-  and  off-balance  sheet  guarantees,
management considers economic conditions,  geographic and agricultural commodity
concentrations,  the credit  profile of the  portfolio,  delinquency  trends and
historical  charge-off and recovery  activity.  The reserve is increased through
periodic  provisions  charged to expense and reduced by  charge-offs  for actual
loan losses, net of recoveries.

     Farmer Mac's provision for losses was $2.0 million for second quarter 2002,
compared to $2.0  million  for first  quarter  2002 and $1.4  million for second
quarter 2001. As of June 30, 2002, Farmer Mac's reserve for losses totaled $18.3
million,  or 41 basis points of the  outstanding  Post-1996  Act loans and AMBS,
compared to $15.9  million (45 basis  points) as of December  31, 2001 and $13.2
million (43 basis points) as of June 30, 2001.

     As of June  30,  2002,  Farmer  Mac I  Post-1996  Act  loans,  both on- and
off-balance  sheet,  that  were 90 days or more  past due,  in  foreclosure,  in
bankruptcy and REO (real estate owned as a result of foreclosure)  totaled $65.2
million and represented  1.45 percent of the principal  balance of all Post-1996
Act loans(1),  compared to $87.1  million  (2.32  percent) as of March 31, 2002,
$58.3  million (1.70  percent) as of December 31, 2001,  and $53.1 million (1.72
percent) as of June 30, 2001. (Farmer Mac assumes 100 percent of the credit risk
on Post-1996 Act loans; pre-1996 Act loans are supported by mandatory 10 percent
subordinated interests that mitigate Farmer Mac's credit exposure.) From quarter
to quarter,  Farmer Mac anticipates  fluctuations in the delinquencies,  both in
dollars and as a percentage  of the  outstanding  portfolio,  with higher levels
likely  at the end of the  first  and  third  quarters  of each  year due to the
semi-annual payment characteristics of most Farmer Mac loans. The year-over-year
increase in dollars is reflective  of the continued  maturation of a significant
segment of Farmer Mac's portfolio of guarantees into its peak default years. The
year-over-year  decline in the ratio of delinquencies to outstanding  guarantees
is reflective of the growth of the portfolio.

_____________________________________
1 The  delinquency  rate as of June 30,  2002  was  initially  reported  as 1.35
percent in the Corporation's  Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC July
19, 2002. Subsequent to that date, the Corporation identified an additional $4.8
million of loans that should have been reported as bankruptcies, which increases
the delinquency  rate as of June 30, 2002 to 1.45 percent.  All are sufficiently
collateralized  and,  as such,  no  change  has been  made to the  Corporation's
specific reserves.  These loans were correctly reported as bankruptcies in prior
reporting periods.

     On a monthly  basis,  Farmer Mac  conducts a  loan-by-loan  analysis of its
delinquencies  to assess the value of the collateral  supporting each individual
loan relative to the total amount due on the loan, including principal, interest
and advances.  In the event that the updated or discounted collateral value does
not support the total amount due, Farmer Mac specifically  allocates reserves to
the loan.  Farmer Mac  charges  off losses  against  the reserve for losses when
management believes a loss has occurred, but no later than the time at which the
Corporation takes possession of the property.  As of June 30, 2002, Farmer Mac's
loan-by-loan analysis of its $65.2 million of delinquent loans and their updated
or discounted  collateral  values  indicated that $14.4 million had insufficient
collateral to cover the loan balance, accrued interest and expenses.  Farmer Mac
has    specifically    allocated    $2.8    million   of   reserves   to   those
under-collateralized  loans.  Farmer Mac's loan-by-loan  analyses indicated that
the remaining $50.8 million of delinquent loans were adequately  collateralized,
based on updated or discounted  collateral  values,  and that the  allocation of
specific  reserves to those loans was not necessary.  As of June 30, 2002, after
the allocation of specific reserves to  under-collateralized  loans,  Farmer Mac
had additional non-specific or general reserves of $15.5 million, bringing total
reserves to $18.3 million.  The following  table  summarizes  the  Corporation's
delinquencies and reserve for losses:

     Based on Farmer Mac's loan-by-loan  analyses,  loan collection  experience,
and continuing  provisions for the reserve for losses,  Farmer Mac believes that
ongoing losses will be covered  adequately by the reserve for losses. In certain
collateral  liquidation  scenarios,  Farmer Mac may recover  amounts  previously
charged  off or incur  additional  losses,  if  liquidation  proceeds  vary from
previous estimates.  During second quarter 2002, Farmer Mac charged off $902,000
in losses against the reserve for losses and recovered  $190,000 from previously
charged off losses, for net charge-offs of $712,000.

     As of June 30, 2002, the weighted-average  original loan-to-value ratio for
all  Post-1996  Act  loans was 49  percent,  and the  weighted-average  original
loan-to-value  ratio for delinquent  loans was 57 percent.  The following  table
summarizes  the  Post-1996 Act  delinquencies  by original  loan-to-value  ratio
(calculated  by dividing the  original  loan  principal  balance by the original
appraised value):

     An  analysis  of  Farmer  Mac's  actual  losses  and  identified   specific
collateral  deficiencies  within the portfolio (by  origination  year) indicates
that Farmer Mac has experienced peak loss years as loans have aged between their
third and fifth years  subsequent to origination,  regardless of the year Farmer
Mac issued its  guarantee.  As a  consequence  of the  combination  of principal
amortization  and collateral value  appreciation,  there are no known collateral
deficiencies  for any  individual  loans in the portfolio  that were  originated
prior to 1997.  While Farmer Mac expects certain loans that have aged past their
fifth year may  become  delinquent  and  possibly  default,  Farmer Mac does not
anticipate significant collateral shortfalls on any such loans.

     Analysis of the portfolio by its  geographic  distribution  indicates  that
losses and  collateral  deficiencies  have been and remain most prevalent in the
loans  concentrated in the Northwest.  This is consistent with the corresponding
commodity  analysis which indicates that Farmer Mac has experienced  higher loss
and collateral  deficiency rates in its loans classified as permanent  plantings
(many of which are located in the  Northwest).  Most of the loans  classified as
permanent  plantings  do not  receive  significant  government  support  and are
therefore  more  susceptible  to  adverse  commodity-specific  economic  trends.
Further, as adverse economic conditions persist for a particular  commodity that
is a  long-term  improvement  on the  land,  such as  permanent  plantings,  the
prospective  sale value of the land is likely to decrease and the related  loans
may  become  under-collateralized.  Farmer  Mac  anticipates  that  one or  more
particular  commodity groups will be under economic pressure at any one time and
actively manages its portfolio to mitigate  concentration risks while preserving
the ability to meet the financing needs of all commodity groups.

     Farmer Mac's  methodologies  for pricing its guarantee fee, managing credit
risks and providing adequate loss reserves consider all of the foregoing factors
and information.


Liquidity and Capital Resources

     Debt Issuances.  Farmer Mac funds its program operations  primarily through
the issuance of debt  obligations  of various  maturities in the public  capital
markets. Farmer Mac's debt obligations consist of Discount Notes and Medium-Term
Notes ("MTNs" and collectively,  "Notes"), issued to obtain funds principally to
cover  the costs of  purchasing  and  holding  Qualified  Loans  and  securities
(including  Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities).  Farmer Mac also issues Notes to
obtain funds for investments,  transaction costs and,  guarantee  payments.  The
Corporation's  Notes are  obligations  of Farmer Mac only:  are not rated by any
rating agency;  and the interest and principal thereon are not guaranteed by and
do not constitute debts or obligations of the Farm Credit  Administration or the
United States or any agency or  instrumentality  of the United States other than
Farmer Mac.  Farmer Mac is an  institution  of the Farm Credit System (a "System
Institution"),  but is not liable for any debt or obligation of any other System
Institution.  Likewise,  neither the Farm Credit System nor any other individual
System Institution is liable for any debt or obligation of Farmer Mac. Income on
Farmer Mac's Notes has no tax exemption under federal law from federal, state or
local taxation.

     Farmer Mac's Board of Directors has  authorized  the issuance of up to $5.0
billion of Notes (of which $3.7 billion was  outstanding  as of June 30,  2002),
subject to  periodic  review of the  adequacy  of that level  relative to Farmer
Mac's borrowing requirements.  Farmer Mac invests the proceeds of such issuances
in program mortgage assets and non-program  investment assets in accordance with
guidelines established by its Board of Directors.

     Liquidity. Farmer Mac also issues Notes to meet other needs associated with
its business operations,  including  liquidity,  and to increase its presence in
the capital markets in order to enhance the liquidity and pricing  efficiency of
its Notes and AMBS  securities  transactions  and so improve the mortgage  rates
available to farmers, ranchers and rural homeowners. During second quarter 2002,
Farmer Mac continued its strategy of using its liquidity investment portfolio to
facilitate  increasing  its ongoing  presence in the  capital  markets,  because
Farmer Mac's mortgage purchase programs do not currently  necessitate daily debt
issuance.  To meet investor  demand for daily  presence in the capital  markets,
Farmer  Mac  issues  Discount  Notes  in  maturities  ranging  from  one  day to
approximately  90 days and invests  the  proceeds  not needed for program  asset
purchases in highly rated securities.  Investments are predominantly  short-term
money market  securities  with  maturities  closely matched to the Discount Note
maturities and floating rate  securities with reset terms closely matched to the
maturity  of  the  Discount  Notes.   The  positive  spread  earned  from  these
investments enhances the net interest income Farmer Mac earns, thereby improving
the net yields at which Farmer Mac will purchase  mortgages from lenders who may
pass that benefit to farmers,  ranchers and rural homeowners  through the Farmer
Mac programs.  The current Board  guidelines  authorize  Farmer Mac to invest in
U.S. Treasury,  agency and instrumentality  obligations;  repurchase agreements;
commercial  paper;  guaranteed  investment  contracts;  certificates of deposit;
federal funds and bankers  acceptances;  certain securities and debt obligations
of corporate and municipal issuers; asset-backed securities; and corporate money
market funds.

     The funding and  liquidity  needs of Farmer  Mac's  business  programs  are
driven by the purchase and retention of Qualified Loans, the maturities of Notes
and  payment of  principal  and  interest on Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities.
Farmer Mac's  primary  sources of funds to meet these needs are issuances of new
Notes,  principal and interest  payments and ongoing  guarantee fees received on
mortgages underlying Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities and the Corporation's net
operating cash flows.

     As a result of Farmer Mac's  regular  issuance of Notes and its status as a
federally  chartered  instrumentality of the United States,  Farmer Mac has been
able to access the capital  markets at favorable  rates.  Throughout  the recent
period of inaccurate and misleading publicity, about the Corporation, Farmer Mac
has  maintained  regular  daily  access  to the  discount  note  market at rates
comparable  to the trading  levels of other GSE  discount  notes.  Farmer  Mac's
continued  ability to access the discount  note market at such  favorable  rates
could be affected by inaccurate  and  misleading  publicity  about Farmer Mac or
unusual trading in its securities.  Farmer Mac believes such factors have caused
spread  levels in  secondary  market  trading of its  outstanding  MTNs to widen
somewhat,  which could affect  spread  levels of new MTN issues.  The  foregoing
factors  are likely to continue to affect MTN spreads in the near term and cause
Farmer Mac to emphasize  floating-to-fixed  interest  rate swaps,  combined with
Discount Note issuance, as a source of fixed-rate funding. While the swap market
provides  favorable fixed rates,  swap  transactions  expose Farmer Mac to basis
risk. If the spreads on the Farmer Mac Discount Notes were to increase  relative
to LIBOR,  Farmer Mac would be exposed to a  commensurate  reduction  on its net
interest  yield on the notional  amount of its  floating-to-fixed  interest rate
swaps and other  LIBOR-based  floating rate assets.  Farmer Mac  compensates for
this risk by pricing  the  required  net yield on  program  asset  purchases  to
reflect  the higher  cost of MTN  issuance  versus the  savings  achieved in the
interest rate swap market.

     Farmer Mac's portfolio of cash and cash equivalent  investments,  comprised
of commercial paper and other  short-term money market  instruments and floating
rate  securities  can be drawn upon as necessary for  liquidity.  As of June 30,
2002, Farmer Mac's cash and cash equivalents and investment  securities  totaled
$479.6 million and $977.5 million, respectively, a combined 36% of total assets.
As a  contingency  plan to ensure  that  Farmer Mac can meet its  funding  needs
should unforeseen circumstances limit Farmer Mac's ability to issue Notes in the
public  capital  markets,  Farmer Mac  maintains  arrangements  to permit  these
investment securities,  as well as Farmer Mac's retained portfolio of Guaranteed
Securities, to be sold or pledged for liquidity under repurchase agreements. For
second quarter 2002,  exclusive of daily overnight  Discount Note issuances that
were invested overnight,  the average Discount Note issuance term and re-funding
frequency was approximately 75 days.


Other Matters

     On June 26, 2002,  the Senate  Committee  on  Agriculture,  Nutrition,  and
Forestry  requested that the GAO conduct an independent  analysis of a number of
issues  relating to Farmer Mac.  The  Committee  made this request of the GAO in
response to recent misleading  reports and speculation about Farmer Mac produced
by certain stock traders,  known as "short  sellers," who are seeking to depress
the price of Farmer  Mac  securities  for their own gain,  and by  corresponding
articles  by a  reporter  for a major  newspaper.  Farmer Mac made it clear that
those reports were flawed and unfounded and welcomed this  independent  analysis
by the GAO as an opportunity  to confirm that Farmer Mac's mission  continues to
be met in a financially sound manner.

     Farmer Mac is confident  that the GAO's analysis will confirm the integrity
and financial stability of the Corporation, as presented in its public financial
disclosures. Farmer Mac expects the GAO report will show that the Corporation is
appropriately   and   effectively   fulfilling   its  mission  to  increase  the
availability  of borrower credit at stable rates,  lender  liquidity and capital
markets funding in the  agricultural  sector of the U.S. economy for the benefit
of farmers,  ranchers and rural homeowners,  lenders participating in Farmer Mac
programs and the investing public.

     The GAO report  was  requested  by the  Committee  specifically  to address
Farmer Mac's financial stability;  corporate governance;  compensation policies;
investment  practices;  the  non-voting  status of Farmer  Mac's  Class C Common
Stock; and the fulfillment of Farmer Mac's Congressionally-established mission.

     Farmer Mac looks forward to the GAO report as an  opportunity to remove the
confusion that has been cast over the  Corporation,  so that it may continue its
Congressional mission in a safe and sound manner.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1. Legal Proceedings

   Farmer Mac is not a party to any material pending legal proceedings.

     Item 2. Changes in Securities and Use of Proceeds

          (a)  Not applicable.

          (b)  Farmer Mac's 6.40% Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A issued on
               May 6, 2002 and  referenced  in paragraph  below has a preference
               over Farmer Mac's  Common  Stock as to payment of  dividends  and
               upon liquidation.

          (c)  Farmer Mac is a federally chartered instrumentality of the United
               States and its Common Stock is exempt from registration  pursuant
               to Section 3(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933.

               Pursuant to Farmer Mac's policy that permits  Directors of Farmer
               Mac to elect to receive shares of Class C Non-Voting Common Stock
               in lieu of their annual cash retainers, on April 25, 2002, Farmer
               Mac issued an  aggregate  of 530 shares of its Class C Non-Voting
               Common  Stock,  at an issue  price of $44.50  per  share,  to the
               eleven  Directors  who  elected to receive  such stock in lieu of
               their cash retainers.

               On June 6, 2002,  Farmer Mac issued an aggregate of 25,788 shares
               of its Class C  Non-Voting  Common  Stock,  at an issue  price of
               $29.10  per share,  to the  officers  of Farmer Mac as  incentive
               compensation.

               During the second  quarter of 2002,  Farmer Mac  granted  options
               under its 1997 Stock  Option  Plan to purchase  an  aggregate  of
               254,421  shares of Class C Non-Voting  Common Stock to employees,
               officers and directors.  Five hundred of the options granted have

Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

          (a)  Farmer Mac's Annual Meeting of  Stockholders  was held on June 6,
               2002.

          (b)  See paragraph (c)(1) below. In addition to the Directors  elected
               at the  Annual  Meeting  of  Stockholders  on June 6,  2002,  the
               following  Directors  appointed  by the  President  of the United
               States continue to serve as Directors of Farmer Mac:

                  Charles Eugene Branstool (Chairman)
                  Lowell L. Junkins
                  Marilyn Peters
                  Gordon Clyde Southern
                  Clyde A. Wheeler, Jr.

               President  Bush's  nominations  of  Frederick L. Dailey and Grace
               Trujillo  Daniel to serve on the Board of Directors of Farmer Mac
               were  confirmed  by the United  States  Senate on August 1, 2002.
               These  appointments  to Farmer Mac's Board will become  effective
               when Mr.  Dailey and Ms.  Daniel  take  their  oaths of office to
               become  Directors of Farmer Mac.  President  Bush has  previously
               announced  that Mr.  Dailey  and Ms.  Daniel  would  replace  Mr.
               Southern and Mr.  Wheeler on the Board and that Mr.  Dailey would
               be  designated  as  Farmer  Mac's  new  Chairman.  Farmer  Mac is
               uncertain when Mr. Dailey and Ms. Daniel will take their oaths of
               office and begin to serve as Directors.
