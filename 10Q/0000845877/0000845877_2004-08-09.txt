     The following interim condensed  consolidated  financial  statements of the

financial  statements reflect all normal and recurring  adjustments that are, in
the  opinion  of  management,  necessary  to  present  a fair  statement  of the

                    NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1.  Accounting Policies

(a)   Cash and Cash Equivalents

     Farmer Mac considers  highly liquid  investment  securities  with remaining
maturities  of  three  months  or  less  at the  time  of  purchase  to be  cash
equivalents. Changes in the balance of cash and cash equivalents are reported in
the Condensed  Consolidated  Statements of Cash Flows.  The following table sets
forth information  regarding certain cash and non-cash  transactions for the six
months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003.

</TABLE>

            (b) Allowance for Losses

     As of June 30, 2004,  Farmer Mac  maintained a $21.8 million  allowance and
contingent  obligation  for probable  losses  ("allowance  for losses") to cover
estimated  probable losses on loans held for investment,  real estate owned, and
loans underlying post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities and long-term
standby  purchase  commitments   ("LTSPCs")  in  accordance  with  Statement  of
Financial  Accounting  Standard No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies  ("SFAS 5"),
and Statement of Financial  Accounting Standard No. 114, Accounting by Creditors
for  Impairment  of a  Loan,  as  amended  ("SFAS  114").  The  methodology  for
determining  the allowance for losses is the same for loans held for  investment
and loans underlying post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs
because Farmer Mac believes the ultimate credit risk is substantially  the same,
i.e.,  the  underlying  agricultural  mortgage  loans  all meet the same  credit
underwriting and appraisal standards.

     The allowance for losses is increased through periodic  provisions for loan
losses that are charged  against net interest  income and  provisions for losses
that are charged to operating  expense and is reduced by charge-offs  for actual
losses,  net of  recoveries.  Charge-offs  represent  losses on the  outstanding
principal  balance,  any  interest  payment  previously  accrued or advanced and
expected costs of liquidation.

     The table below  summarizes  the  components of Farmer Mac's  allowance for
losses, which includes its contingent obligation for probable losses, as of June
30, 2004 and December 31, 2003.

</TABLE>

     No  allowance  for losses has been made for loans  underlying  Farmer Mac I
Guaranteed  Securities issued prior to the Farm Credit System Reform Act of 1996
(the "1996 Act") or securities  issued under the Farmer Mac II program  ("Farmer
Mac II Guaranteed Securities").  Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities issued prior
to the 1996 Act are supported by unguaranteed first loss subordinated interests,
which are structured to exceed the estimated  credit losses on those loans.  The
guaranteed portions of loans collateralizing Farmer Mac II Guaranteed Securities
are  guaranteed by the United States  Department of Agriculture  ("USDA").  Each
USDA  guarantee  is an  obligation  backed by the full  faith and  credit of the
United  States.  To date,  Farmer Mac has  experienced  no credit  losses on any
pre-1996  Act  Farmer  Mac I  Guaranteed  Securities  or on  any  Farmer  Mac II
Guaranteed  Securities  and does not  expect  to incur  any such  losses  in the
future.

            (c) Financial Derivatives

     Farmer Mac enters into  financial  derivative  transactions  principally to
protect against risk from the effects of market price or interest rate movements
on the value of certain assets and future cash flows or debt  issuance,  not for
trading or  speculative  purposes.  Farmer Mac enters  into  interest  rate swap
contracts  principally to adjust the  characteristics  of its short-term debt to
match more closely the cash flow and duration characteristics of its longer-term
mortgage  and  other  assets,  and also to  adjust  the  characteristics  of its
long-term debt to match more closely the cash flow and duration  characteristics
of  its  short-term   assets,   thereby  reducing   interest  rate  risk.  These
transactions  also may provide an overall lower effective cost of borrowing than
would otherwise be available in the conventional debt market.

     All financial  derivatives  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value
as  a  freestanding  asset  or  liability.   Financial  derivatives  in  hedging
relationships  that mitigate exposure to changes in the fair value of assets are
considered  fair value hedges.  Financial  derivatives in hedging  relationships
that mitigate the exposure to the  variability in expected  future cash flows or
other  forecasted  transactions  are  considered  cash  flow  hedges.  Financial
derivatives  that do not satisfy the hedging  criteria of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative  Instruments and Hedging
Activities,  as amended ("SFAS 133") are not accounted for as hedges and changes
in the fair  values of those  financial  derivatives  are  reported  as gains or
losses on financial derivatives and trading assets in the condensed consolidated
statements of operations.

     As of June 30,  2004,  Farmer Mac had  approximately  $30.9  million of net
after-tax  unrealized  losses on cash flow hedges included in accumulated  other
comprehensive income/(loss). These amounts will be reclassified into earnings in
the same  period or  periods  during  which the hedged  forecasted  transactions
(either  the payment of interest  or the  issuance  of  discount  notes)  affect
earnings  or  immediately  when it becomes  probable  that the  original  hedged
forecasted  transaction  will not occur  within  two  months  of the  originally
specified  date.  Over the next twelve  months,  Farmer Mac estimates  that $5.3
million of the amount  currently  reported in  accumulated  other  comprehensive
income/(loss) will be reclassified into earnings. For the quarter ended June 30,
2004,  any  ineffectiveness  related  to  Farmer  Mac's  designated  hedges  was
insignificant.

            (d) Earnings Per Common Share

     Basic earnings per common share are based on the weighted-average number of
common shares  outstanding.  Diluted  earnings per common share are based on the
weighted-average  number of common  shares  outstanding  adjusted to include all
potentially  dilutive common stock options.  The following  schedule  reconciles
basic and diluted  earnings  per common share for the three and six months ended
June 30, 2004 and 2003:

            (e) Stock-Based Compensation

     Farmer Mac accounts for its stock-based  employee  compensation plans using
the intrinsic value method of accounting for employee stock options  pursuant to
Accounting  Principles  Board  Opinion No. 25,  Accounting  for Stock  Issued to
Employees,  and has adopted  the  disclosure-only  provisions  of  Statement  of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,
as amended ("SFAS 123"). Accordingly,  no compensation expense was recognized in
second  quarter  2004 or second  quarter 2003 for employee  stock  options.  Had
Farmer Mac elected to use the fair value method of accounting for employee stock
options,  net income available to common stockholders and earnings per share for
the three and six months  ended June 30, 2004 and 2003,  would have been reduced
to the pro forma amounts indicated in the following table:

            (f) Reclassifications

      Certain reclassifications of prior period information were made to conform
to the current period presentation.

            (g) New Accounting Standards

     In March 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF")  amended EITF 03-01,
The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary  Impairment, to introduce a three-step model
to: (1) determine  whether an investment is impaired;  (2) evaluate  whether the
impairment  is  other-than-temporary;  and (3) account for  other-than-temporary
impairments. In part, this amendment requires companies to apply qualitative and
quantitative  measures  to  determine  whether a decline  in the fair value of a
security is other-than-temporary.  The amount of other-than-temporary impairment
to be  recognized,  if any, will depend on market  conditions  and  management's
intent and ability to hold  investments  until the  forecasted  recovery in fair
value.  This amendment is effective for financial  periods  beginning after June
15, 2004. Farmer Mac is evaluating this amendment and will adopt it beginning in
third quarter 2004.

     On January 1, 2003, Farmer Mac adopted the liability recognition provisions
of the Financial  Accounting  Standards Board Interpretation No. 45, Guarantor's
Accounting  and  Disclosure  Requirements  for  Guarantees,  Including  Indirect
Guarantees of  Indebtedness  of Others ("FIN 45"),  which requires Farmer Mac to
recognize,  at the  inception of a guarantee,  a liability for the fair value of
its  obligation  to stand  ready to  perform  under the terms of each  guarantee
agreement  and an asset that is equal to the fair value of the fees that will be
received over the life of each  guarantee.  In December 2003, the Securities and
Exchange Commission provided additional guidance on the "day two" accounting for
these financial  instruments.  In accordance with this guidance,  Farmer Mac has
adopted the amortized cost model for day two accounting  prospectively effective
January 1, 2004.

     These sensitivities are hypothetical.  As the figures indicate,  changes in
fair value based on a 10 percent  variation in assumptions  generally  cannot be
extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumptions to the change
in fair value may not be linear.  Also,  in this table the effect of a variation
in a  particular  assumption  on the fair  value  of the  retained  interest  is
calculated without changing any other assumption. In fact, changes in one factor
may result in changes in another  (for  example,  increases  in market  interest
rates may result in lower  prepayments),  which might amplify or counteract  the
sensitivities.

Note 3.  Off-Balance Sheet Guarantees and Long-Term Standby Purchase Commitments

Overview

     Farmer Mac offers  approved  agricultural  and rural  residential  mortgage
lenders two  off-balance  sheet  alternatives  to increase  their  liquidity  or
lending  capacity  while  retaining the cash flow  benefits of their loans:  (1)
Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities,  which are available through either the Farmer
Mac I program or the Farmer Mac II program,  and (2) LTSPCs, which are available
only  through  the Farmer Mac I program.  Both of these  alternatives  result in
off-balance sheet transactions for Farmer Mac.


Off-Balance Sheet Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities

     Periodically Farmer Mac transfers  agricultural  mortgage loans into trusts
that are used as vehicles for the  securitization of the transferred  assets and
the beneficial  interests in the trusts are sold to third party  investors.  The
table  below  summarizes  certain  cash  flows  received  from and paid to these
trusts.

</TABLE>

     As of June 30, 2004, the  weighted-average  remaining maturity of all loans
underlying  off-balance  sheet Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities was 16.3 years.
For the off-balance sheet Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities that were executed
on or before  December  31,  2002,  Farmer Mac has  recorded  an  allowance  for
probable  losses of $1.2  million  as of June 30,  2004 and $1.1  million  as of

January  1,  2003,  Farmer  Mac has  recorded  the  fair  value  of its  initial
obligation  to stand ready under the  guarantee as a liability.  This  liability
approximated  $4.8  million as of June 30, 2004 and $4.1  million as of December
31, 2003 and is reported  in the  guarantee  and  commitment  obligation  on the
condensed consolidated balance sheet.

Long-Term Standby Purchase Commitments (LTSPCs)

     An LTSPC is a commitment by Farmer Mac to purchase  eligible loans,  either
for cash or in exchange for Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities,  on one or more
undetermined future dates.

     As of June 30, 2004 and December 31, 2003, the maximum  principal amount of
potential  undiscounted  future  payments  that Farmer Mac could be requested to
make under LTSPCs,  not including  offsets provided by any recourse  provisions,
recoveries from third parties or collateral for the underlying  loans,  was $2.4
billion and $2.3  billion,  respectively.  For all LTSPC  transactions  to date,
Farmer Mac has incurred a charge-off on one loan.

     As of June 30, 2004, the  weighted-average  remaining maturity of all loans
underlying LTSPCs was 14.7 years. For the LTSPCs that were executed on or before
December 31, 2002,  Farmer Mac has recorded an allowance for probable  losses of
$9.5 million as of June 30, 2004 and $9.2  million as of December 31, 2003.  For
those  LTSPCs that were issued or modified on or after  January 1, 2003,  Farmer
Mac has recorded the fair value of its initial  obligation  to stand ready under
the commitment as a liability.  This liability  approximated  $9.4 million as of
June 30, 2004 and $7.3  million as of December  31, 2003 and was included in the
guarantee and commitment obligation on the condensed consolidated balance sheet.

Item 2. Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
        of Operations

     You should  read the  following  Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis of
Financial  Condition  and  Results of  Operations  in  conjunction  with (1) the
condensed  consolidated  financial  statements and the related notes that appear
elsewhere in this report and (2) Farmer Mac's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2003.

Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

     Certain  statements  made in this report are  "forward-looking  statements"
within  the  meaning of the  Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform Act of 1995
pertaining  to  management's  current  expectations  as to Farmer  Mac's  future
financial results, business prospects and business developments. Forward-looking
statements  include,  without  limitation,   any  statement  that  may  predict,
forecast,  indicate or imply future results,  performance or  achievements,  and
typically are accompanied by, and identified with, such terms as  "anticipates,"
"believes,"  "expects,"  "intends," "should" and similar phrases.  The following
management's  discussion  and  analysis  includes   forward-looking   statements
addressing Farmer Mac's:

          o    prospects for earnings;
          o    growth in loan  purchase,  guarantee,  LTSPC  and  securitization
               volume;
          o    trends in net interest income;
          o    trends in provisions for losses;
          o    changes in capital position; and
          o    other business and financial matters.

     Management's  expectations  for Farmer Mac's future  necessarily  involve a
number  of   assumptions   and  estimates  and  the   evaluation  of  risks  and
uncertainties. Various factors could cause Farmer Mac's actual results or events
to differ  materially  from the  expectations  as  expressed  or  implied by the
forward-looking statements, including uncertainties regarding:

          o    the rate and direction of development of the secondary market for
               agricultural mortgage loans;
          o    the possible  establishment of additional statutory or regulatory
               restrictions  or  constraints on Farmer Mac that could hamper its
               growth or diminish its profitability;
          o    legislative  or regulatory  developments  or  interpretations  of
               Farmer Mac's statutory charter that could adversely affect Farmer
               Mac  or  the  ability  or  motivation   of  certain   lenders  to
               participate   in  its   programs   or  the   terms  of  any  such
               participation,  or increase  the cost of  regulation  and related
               corporate activities;
          o    possible  reaction in the financial  markets to events  involving
               government-sponsored enterprises other than Farmer Mac;
          o    Farmer Mac's  access to the debt  markets at favorable  rates and
               terms;
          o    the possible effect of the risk-based capital requirement,  which
               could, under certain circumstances, be in excess of the statutory
               minimum capital requirement;
          o    the rate of growth in agricultural mortgage indebtedness;
          o    lender  interest in Farmer Mac credit products and the Farmer Mac
               secondary market;
          o    borrower   preferences  for  fixed-rate   agricultural   mortgage
               indebtedness;
          o    competitive  pressures in the purchase of  agricultural  mortgage
               loans and the sale of agricultural mortgage-backed securities and
               debt securities;
          o    substantial changes in interest rates,  agricultural land values,
               commodity prices,  export demand for U.S.  agricultural  products
               and the general economy;
          o    protracted adverse weather,  market or other conditions affecting
               particular  geographic regions or particular  commodities related
               to  agricultural  mortgage  loans backing Farmer Mac I Guaranteed
               Securities or under LTSPCs;
          o    the   willingness   of  investors   to  invest  in   agricultural
               mortgage-backed securities; or
          o    the  effects  on  the  agricultural   economy  or  the  value  of
               agricultural real estate of any changes in federal assistance for
               agriculture.

     The foregoing factors are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report may
include additional factors that could adversely affect Farmer Mac's business and
its financial  performance.  Furthermore,  new risk factors  emerge from time to
time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor
assess the  effects of such  factors on Farmer  Mac's  business or the extent to
which any factor, or combination of factors,  may cause actual results to differ
materially  from the  expectations  expressed or implied by the  forward-looking
statements.  In light of  these  potential  risks  and  uncertainties,  no undue
reliance should be placed on any  forward-looking  statements  expressed in this
report. Furthermore, Farmer Mac undertakes no obligation to release publicly the
results  of  revisions  to any  forward-looking  statements  that may be made to
reflect any future events or circumstances,  except as otherwise mandated by the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

Critical Accounting Policy and Estimates

     The critical  accounting  policy that is both important to the portrayal of
Farmer Mac's financial condition and results of operations and requires complex,
subjective  judgments is the accounting policy for the allowance for losses. For
a discussion of Farmer Mac's critical accounting policy, as well as Farmer Mac's
use of  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect the  amounts  reported  in the
condensed  consolidated  financial  statements and related notes for the periods
presented,  see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results  of  Operations--Critical   Accounting  Policy  and  Estimates"  in  the
Corporation's  Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended  December 31, 2003,
filed with the SEC on March 15, 2004.

Results of Operations

     Overview.  Net income  available to common  stockholders for second quarter
2004 was $2.0  million  or $0.16 per  diluted  common  share,  compared  to $8.4
million or $0.70 per diluted common share for second quarter 2003. This decrease
was principally  due to the decrease in the fair value of financial  derivatives
as accounted for in accordance with SFAS 133, as explained below.  During second
quarter 2004, Farmer Mac:

          o    added $127.1 million of Farmer Mac I eligible loans under LTSPCs;
          o    purchased $27.5 million of newly originated Farmer Mac I eligible
               loans; and
          o    purchased $34.7 million of Farmer Mac II eligible USDA-guaranteed
               portions of loans.

     USDA is currently  forecasting  national  farm cash receipts to increase to
$215.0 billion in 2004 from the $212.4 billion  forecasted level in 2003. Prices
available to farmers have been rising as a result of strong domestic and foreign
demand.  Forecasted net cash income on farms for 2004 is $55.9  billion,  a $7.1
billion decrease from 2003 forecasted levels of $63.0 billion,  but still higher
than the $49.1 billion level of 2002.  The  forecasted  net cash income on farms
for 2004 includes  government  payments of $10.3  billion,  as compared to $17.4
billion in 2003 and $11.0 billion in 2002.

     Despite  the  decline  in farm  income in 2004,  the rise in farm  business
assets,  debt, and equity values is expected to continue  through the end of the
year.  USDA  forecasts  the value of U.S.  farm real  estate  assets to rise 3.5
percent to $1.13  trillion in 2004, up from $1.09  trillion in 2003.  Total farm
real estate debt is expected to approach  $116.5  billion by the end of 2004,  a
4.7 percent  increase over the 2003 level.  This more moderate rise in farm real
estate  debt  follows  growth of 7.7  percent  in 2003 and 7.7  percent in 2002.
Sector  equity is  expected  to rise more than 3  percent,  as the gain in asset
values exceeds the increase in debt by approximately $36 billion.

     The financial  measures  reflect farm  investors'  and lenders'  collective
decisions about the long-term  expected  profitability  of farm  investments and
agriculture  generally.  These expectations should be favorable for Farmer Mac's
long-term  business  plans,  as they  indicate  increased  U.S. farm real estate
values,  an expanding  mortgageable farm real estate base, and a stronger equity
position in U.S. agriculture, which should in the aggregate improve Farmer Mac's
ability to recover in foreclosures.

     Farmer  Mac is  subject  to  interest  rate  risk on all  assets  held  for
investment  because  of  possible  timing  differences  in the cash flows of the
assets and related liabilities. This risk is primarily related to loans held and
on-balance  sheet  Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities  because of the ability of
borrowers to prepay their  mortgages  before the scheduled  maturities,  thereby
increasing  the  risk  of  asset  and  liability  cash  flow  mismatches.  Yield
maintenance   provisions  and  other  prepayment  penalties  contained  in  many
agricultural mortgage loans reduce, but do not eliminate,  this prepayment risk,
particularly in the case of a defaulted loan where yield  maintenance may not be
collected.

     Farmer Mac's primary  exposure to credit risk is the risk of loss resulting
from the inability of borrowers to repay their  mortgages in conjunction  with a
deficiency in the value of the collateral  relative to the amount outstanding on
the  mortgage  and  the  costs  of  liquidation.   Farmer  Mac  has  established
underwriting,  appraisal and documentation  standards for agricultural  mortgage
loans to  mitigate  the  risk of loss  from  borrower  defaults  and to  provide
guidance  concerning the management,  administration and conduct of underwriting
and  appraisals  to all  participating  sellers  and  potential  sellers  in its
programs.

     As of June 30,  2004,  Farmer  Mac's  outstanding  program  volume was $5.6
billion, which represented  approximately 13 percent of management's estimate of
a $44.5 billion market of eligible  agricultural  mortgage loans. For Farmer Mac
to succeed in realizing its business  development and  profitability  objectives
over  the  longer  term,  the use of  Farmer  Mac's  programs  and  products  by
agricultural  mortgage lenders,  whether  traditional or  non-traditional,  must
continue to expand.

     In the  aggregate,  approximately  285 lenders were actively  participating
either  directly or  indirectly in one or both of the Farmer Mac I or Farmer Mac
II programs as of June 30, 2004, with loans to approximately 20,000 borrowers.

     As of June 30, 2004, there were 144 approved loan sellers in the Farmer Mac
I program  ranging from  single-office  to multi-branch  institutions,  spanning
community banks,  Farm Credit System  associations,  mortgage  companies,  large
multi-state Farm Credit System banks,  commercial banks and insurance companies.
During  2003,  there were 81 approved  loan  sellers  active in the Farmer Mac I
program. In addition to participating directly in the Farmer Mac I program, some
of the approved loan sellers enable other lenders to  participate  indirectly in
the Farmer Mac I program by  managing  correspondent  networks  of lenders  from
which they purchase loans to sell to Farmer Mac. As of June 30, 2004,  more than
75 lenders were participating in those networks, bringing the total Farmer Mac I
program participants to more than 200 as of June 30, 2004.

     Any lender  authorized by the USDA to obtain a USDA guarantee on a loan may
be a seller in the Farmer Mac II program.  As of June 30,  2004,  there were 128
active sellers in the Farmer Mac II program,  compared to 150 as of December 31,
2003 and 143 as of June 30, 2003.  Sellers in the Farmer Mac II program  consist
mostly of community and regional banks.

     Set forth below is a more  detailed  discussion  of Farmer Mac's results of
operations.

     Net Interest Income. Net interest income,  which does not include guarantee
fees for loans purchased prior to April 1, 2001 (the effective date of Statement
of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  140,  Accounting  for  Transfers  and
Servicing of Financial Assets and  Extinguishments of Liabilities ("SFAS 140")),
was $7.8 million for second  quarter  2004 and $17.3  million for the six months
ended June 30, 2004,  compared to $9.4 million and $19.2 million,  respectively,
for the same periods in 2003. The net interest yield was 87 basis points for the
six months ended June 30,  2004,  compared to 95 basis points for the six months
ended  June  30,   2003.   The  effect  of  the  adoption  of  SFAS  140  was  a
reclassification  of  approximately  $2.2 million (11 basis points) of guarantee
fee income as interest  income for the six months ended June 30, 2004,  compared
to $2.2 million (11 basis points) for the six months ended June 30, 2003.

     As a result of the application of additional  guidance  provided in 2003 by
the Chief  Accountant at the U.S.  Securities and Exchange  Commission,  the net
interest income and expense  realized on financial  derivatives  that are not in
fair  value or cash flow hedge  relationships  have been  reclassified  from net
interest  income  into gains and losses on  financial  derivatives  and  trading
assets.  For the six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003, this  reclassification
resulted in the  decrease  of the net  interest  yield of 5 basis  points and an
increase of 3 basis points, respectively.

     The net  interest  yields for the six months  ended June 30,  2004 and 2003
included the benefits of yield maintenance payments received of 12 basis points.
Yield  maintenance  payments  represent  the present  value of  expected  future
interest  income streams and accelerate the  recognition of interest income from
the  related  loans.  Because  the timing and  amounts  of these  payments  vary
greatly,  variations should not be considered indicative of positive or negative
trends to gauge future financial results. For the six months ended June 30, 2004
and 2003,  the effects of yield  maintenance  payments on net income and diluted
earnings per share were $1.6 million or $0.13 per diluted share and $1.7 million
or $0.14 per diluted share, respectively.

     The following table provides information regarding the average balances and
rates of  interest-earning  assets and funding for the six months ended June 30,
2004 and 2003.  The  balance of  non-accruing  loans is  included in the average
balance  of  interest-earning  loans  presented,  though  no  related  income is
included in the income figures presented. The decreases in the average rates for
cash and cash equivalents  reflect their short-term nature. The decreases in the
average rates for  investments  and loans and Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities
reflect the  relatively  large  proportion  of  adjustable  rates in those asset
categories (69.9 percent of investments and 65.8 percent of loans and Farmer Mac
Guaranteed Securities). The decrease in the average rate for discount notes also
reflects their short-term  nature. The decreases in all of these rates track the
general decrease in market rates between the two periods.

     The  following  table sets forth  information  regarding the changes in the
components of Farmer Mac's net interest  income for the periods  indicated.  For
each  category,  information is provided on changes  attributable  to changes in
volume (change in volume  multiplied by old rate) and changes in rate (change in
rate  multiplied  by old  volume).  Combined  rate/volume  variances,  the third
element of the  calculation,  are allocated  based on their  relative  size. The
decreases due to rate reflect the short-term or  adjustable-rate  nature of most
assets or liabilities and the general decreases in market rates described above.

</TABLE>

     See  "Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis of  Financial  Condition  and
Results of  Operations--Regulatory  Matters" for actions by Farmer Mac's federal
regulator,  the Farm Credit Administration  ("FCA"), that may potentially affect
future net interest income.

     Guarantee and  Commitment  Fees.  Guarantee and  commitment  fees were $5.3
million for second  quarter  2004,  compared to $5.1 million for second  quarter
2003. The increase in guarantee and commitment  fees reflects an increase in the
average  balance  of  outstanding  guarantees  and  LTSPCs.  The  effects of the
adoption  of SFAS 140  reclassified  $1.1  million  of  guarantee  fee income as
interest  income  for second  quarter  2004 and second  quarter  2003,  although
management  considers  the amount to have been earned in  consideration  for the
assumption of credit risk.  That portion of the  difference or "spread"  between
the cost of Farmer Mac's debt  funding for loans and the yield on post-1996  Act
Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities held on its books compensates for credit and
interest rate risk. If a post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Security is sold
to a third party, Farmer Mac continues to receive the guarantee fee component of
that spread,  which  continues to  compensate  Farmer Mac for its  assumption of
credit risk. The portion of the spread that  compensates  for interest rate risk
would not  typically  continue  to be  received  by Farmer Mac if the asset were
sold, except to the extent attributable to any retained interest-only strip.

     Farmer Mac's  ongoing  guarantee  and  commitment  fee income  reflects the
annuity-like revenue stream of that aspect of the Corporation's  business.  That
fee  income  is  earned  on the  cumulative  outstanding  principal  balance  of
guaranteed  securities and loans underlying LTSPCs.  Accordingly,  GAAP earnings
increase or decrease  through changes in periodic  business volume in proportion
to  the  change  in  that  cumulative  outstanding  principal  balance,  not  in
proportion to the change in periodic volume.

     Other  Income.  During  second  quarter  2004,  through a  competitive  bid
process, the Corporation sold Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities in the amount of
$26.9  million  to a related  party in a  transaction  that  resulted  in a $0.4
million gain on sale. Also during the quarter,  Farmer Mac received $1.8 million
from  two  sellers  (one  of  which  was  a  related   party)  for  breaches  of
representations  and  warranties  associated  with prior  sales of  agricultural
mortgage  loans to Farmer  Mac.  Farmer  Mac had  previously  charged  off these
amounts as losses on the associated loans.

     Expenses.  Compensation and employee  benefits for second quarter 2004 were
$1.7  million,  compared to $1.5 million for second  quarter  2003.  General and
administrative  expenses for second quarter 2004 were $1.8 million,  compared to
$1.2 million for second quarter 2003. The increases in compensation and employee
benefits and general and  administrative  expenses  were due, in large part,  to
increased  staffing  levels  necessary  for  increased   regulatory   compliance
activities, including requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and FCA, as
well as heightened focus on the regulatory environment for  government-sponsored
enterprises  generally.  Regulatory fees assessed by FCA for second quarter 2004
and 2003 were $0.6  million  and $0.4  million,  respectively.  FCA has  advised
Farmer Mac that its estimated assessment level for the year ending September 30,
2004 will be $1.7 million.  After the end of a federal  government  fiscal year,
FCA may revise its prior year  estimated  assessments  to reflect  actual  costs
incurred, and has issued both additional assessments and refunds in the past.

     Farmer Mac's total provision for losses was $1.6 million for second quarter
2004, compared to $1.9 million for second quarter 2003. (See "--Quantitative and
Qualitative   Disclosures  About  Market  Risk   Management--Credit   Risk"  for
additional information regarding Farmer Mac's provision for losses and provision
for loan losses.) As of June 30, 2004,  Farmer Mac's total  allowance for losses
totaled  $21.8  million,  or 0.45  percent  of  outstanding  loans held or loans
underlying post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs, compared
to $22.1  million (0.44 percent of  outstanding  loans held or loans  underlying
post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities and LTSPCs) as of December 31,
2003.

     Gains and Losses on Financial  Derivatives and Trading  Assets.  For second
quarter  2004,  the loss on financial  derivatives  and trading  assets was $6.2
million, compared to a gain of $3.7 million for second quarter 2003. The loss in
second quarter 2004 and the gain in second quarter 2003 resulted  primarily from
fluctuations  in the  fair  values  of  financial  derivatives,  resulting  from
movements in interest rates,  that have not been designated in either fair value
or cash flow hedge relationships in accordance with SFAS 133.

     Non-GAAP Performance Measures.  Farmer Mac reports its financial results in
accordance with GAAP. In addition to GAAP measures,  Farmer Mac presents certain
non-GAAP  performance  measures.  Farmer  Mac uses  these  non-GAAP  performance
measures to develop financial plans, to measure corporate economic  performance,
and to set incentive compensation.  As described below, because FASB has adopted
a mixed  attribute  accounting  model that does not  reflect the  economics  for
transactions  involving  Farmer Mac's callable swaps,  in management's  view the
non-GAAP  measures  provide  a more  accurate  representation  of  Farmer  Mac's
economic performance,  transaction economics and business trends.  Investors and
the investment analyst community have previously relied upon similar measures to
evaluate  performance and issue projections.  These non-GAAP disclosures are not
intended to replace GAAP information but, rather, to supplement it.

     One such non-GAAP  measure is core earnings,  which Farmer Mac developed to
present net income less the after-tax effects of SFAS 133. Core earnings for the
three and six months  ended June 30, 2004 were $6.2  million and $12.1  million,
respectively,  compared to $5.8 million and $11.7  million for the three and six
months ended June 30, 2003. The  reconciliation  of GAAP net income available to
common stockholders to core earnings is presented in the following table:

     The  weighted-average  age of the Farmer Mac I newly originated and current

less than one month. Of the Farmer Mac I newly  originated and current  seasoned
loans  purchased  during second quarter 2004 and second quarter 2003, 80 percent
and 75 percent, respectively, had principal amortization periods longer than the
maturity   date,   resulting   in  balloon   payments   at   maturity,   with  a
weighted-average  remaining  term to  maturity  of 15.2  years  and 15.1  years,
respectively.  The  weighted-average  age of delinquent  loans  purchased out of
securitized  pools and LTSPCs during second quarter 2004 and second quarter 2003
was 5.0 years and 6.1 years, respectively.

     As of June 30, 2004, outstanding commitments to purchase Farmer Mac I loans

total Farmer Mac I commitments  outstanding  as of June 30, 2004 and 2003,  $5.4

submitted  for  approval or approved but not yet  committed to purchase  totaled
$18.7  million as of June 30,  2004,  compared  to $59.8  million as of June 30,
2003.  Not all of these  loans will be  purchased,  as some will  ultimately  be
denied for credit reasons or withdrawn by the seller.

     New business volume for second quarter 2004 was $189.3 million, down $133.0
million from the same period in 2003. Presently,  Farmer Mac's new business with
agricultural mortgage lenders has been slowed by:

          o    reduced growth rates in the agricultural mortgage market;
          o    increased liquidity of agricultural borrowers;
          o    increased  capital and liquidity at those  agricultural  mortgage
               lenders in the current interest rate and regulatory environments;
               and
          o    increased    regulatory    pressure    on    government-sponsored
               enterprises.

     Regulatory  actions by the Farm Credit  Administration  (FCA),  the federal
regulator of both Farmer Mac and the primary  lenders in the Farm Credit  System
(FCS)  and  the  Farm  Credit  System  Insurance  Corporation  (FCSIC),  a  U.S.
Government  controlled  corporation managed by a three-member board of directors
composed of the members of the FCA Board,  may diminish  Farmer  Mac's  business
prospects.  Statements by either FCA or FCSIC,  or both,  have  cautioned  other
entities they regulate about doing business with GSEs, including Farmer Mac, and
have  raised  objections  to FCS  institutions'  use of Farmer  Mac  swaps.  See
"Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis of Financial  Condition  and Results of
Operations--Regulatory  Matters" for other  actions by FCA that may  potentially
affect existing and future business volume.

     Notwithstanding  the developments  described above, Farmer Mac continues to
see promising new business opportunities, with marketing initiatives advanced by
new and expanded business relationships, including a strategic alliance, product
enhancements and refined security structures.

Balance Sheet Review

     During the six months ended June 30, 2004, total assets decreased by $219.1
million from December 31, 2003,  with  decreases in program  assets  (Farmer Mac
Guaranteed  Securities  and loans) of $169.0  million.  For further  information
regarding off-balance sheet program activities, see "--Off-Balance Sheet Program
Activities"  below.  Consistent  with the  decrease in total  assets  during the
period, total liabilities  decreased by $231.9 million from December 31, 2003 to
June 30, 2004.

     During the six months ended June 30, 2004,  accumulated other comprehensive
income/(loss)  increased  $2.1 million,  which is the net after-tax  effect of a
$12.5 million decrease in unrealized gains on securities  available for sale and
a $14.6 million increase in the fair value of financial  derivatives  classified
as cash flow hedges.  Accumulated  other  comprehensive  income/(loss)  is not a
component of Farmer Mac's core capital or regulatory capital.

     As of June 30,  2004,  Farmer Mac's core capital  totaled  $226.3  million,
compared to $215.5  million as of December 31, 2003.  As of June 30, 2004,  core
capital  exceeded Farmer Mac's statutory  minimum capital  requirement of $136.4
million by $89.9 million.

     Farmer Mac was in compliance  with the risk-based  capital  standards under
the regulation as of June 30, 2004. As of June 30, 2004, the risk-based  capital
stress test generated a regulatory capital requirement of $49.3 million.  Farmer
Mac's regulatory capital of $247.5 million exceeded that amount by approximately
$198.2 million. The increase in the risk-based capital requirement from December
31, 2003  ($38.8  million)  to June 30,  2004  ($49.3  million)  was a result of
changes in the interest rate environment. Farmer Mac is required to hold capital
at the  higher  of the  statutory  minimum  capital  requirement  or the  amount
required by the risk-based capital stress test.

Off-Balance Sheet Program Activities

     Farmer Mac offers  approved  agricultural  and rural  residential  mortgage
lenders two  off-balance  sheet  alternatives  to increase  their  liquidity  or
lending  capacity  while  retaining the cash flow  benefits of their loans:  (1)
Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities,  which are available through either the Farmer
Mac I program or the Farmer Mac II program,  and (2) LTSPCs, which are available
only  through  the Farmer Mac I program.  Both of these  alternatives  result in
off-balance sheet transactions for Farmer Mac.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Management

     Interest  Rate Risk.  Farmer Mac is  subject to  interest  rate risk on all
assets held for investment  because of possible  timing  differences in the cash
flows of the assets and related  liabilities.  This risk is primarily related to
loans held and on-balance sheet Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities because of the
ability of borrowers to prepay their mortgages before the scheduled  maturities,
thereby  increasing the risk of asset and liability cash flow  mismatches.  Cash
flow mismatches in a changing  interest rate environment can reduce the earnings
of the  Corporation  if assets repay sooner than expected and the resulting cash
flows must be reinvested in lower-yielding investments when Farmer Mac's funding
costs  cannot be  correspondingly  reduced,  or if assets repay more slowly than
expected and the associated debt must be replaced by higher-cost debt.

     Yield maintenance  provisions and other prepayment  penalties  contained in
many agricultural  mortgage loans reduce, but do not eliminate,  this prepayment
risk,  particularly in the case of a defaulted loan where yield  maintenance may
not be  collected.  Those  provisions  require  borrowers to make an  additional
payment when they prepay their loans,  so that, when reinvested with the prepaid
principal, yield maintenance payments generate substantially the same cash flows
that would have been generated had the loan not prepaid. Those provisions create
a disincentive  to prepayment and  compensate the  Corporation  for its interest
rate risks to a large degree. As of June 30, 2004, 58 percent of the outstanding
balance of all loans held and loans  underlying  on-balance  sheet  Farmer Mac I
Guaranteed  Securities  (including  79 percent of all loans with fixed  interest
rates)  were  covered  by yield  maintenance  provisions  and  other  prepayment
penalties. Of the Farmer Mac I new and current loans purchased in second quarter
2004,  nine  percent  had  yield  maintenance  or  another  form  of  prepayment
protection.  None  of the  USDA-guaranteed  portions  underlying  Farmer  Mac II
Guaranteed Securities had yield maintenance provisions.

     Cash and cash  equivalents  and  investment  securities  pose only  limited
interest rate risk, due to their closely  matched  funding.  Farmer Mac's $581.5
million of cash and cash  equivalents  as of June 30, 2004 mature  within  three
months and are  match-funded  with  discount  notes having  similar  maturities.
Investment  securities  of $1.1  billion as of June 30,  2004  consist of $773.7
million  (69.9  percent) of floating  rate  securities  that all have rates that
adjust within one year. These floating rate investments are funded using:

          o    a series of  discount  note  issuances  in which each  successive
               discount note is issued and matures on or about the corresponding
               interest rate reset date of the related investment;
          o    floating-rate  notes having similar rate reset  provisions as the
               related investment; or
          o    fixed-rate  notes swapped to floating  rates having similar reset
               provisions as the related investment.

     The most  comprehensive  stress test of the long-term interest rate risk in
Farmer Mac's current  portfolio is the sensitivity of its Market Value of Equity
("MVE") to yield curve shocks.  MVE  represents  the present value of all future
cash flows from on- and  off-balance  sheet  assets,  liabilities  and financial
derivatives,  discounted at current  interest  rates and spreads.  The following
schedule  summarizes the results of Farmer Mac's MVE sensitivity  analysis as of
June 30, 2004 and December 31, 2003 to an immediate and  instantaneous  parallel
shift in the yield curve.

</TABLE>

     During second quarter 2004, Farmer Mac maintained a relatively low level of
interest  rate  sensitivity  through  ongoing  asset  and  liability  management
activities.  As of June 30, 2004, a uniform or "parallel"  increase of 100 basis
points would have increased  NII, a shorter-term  measure of interest rate risk,
by 8.2  percent,  while a  parallel  decrease  of 100 basis  points  would  have
decreased NII by 9.8 percent.  Farmer Mac also measures the  sensitivity of both
MVE and  NII to a  variety  of  non-parallel  interest  rate  shocks,  including
flattening and steepening yield curve  scenarios.  As of June 30, 2004, both MVE
and NII showed similar or lesser  sensitivity to  non-parallel  shocks as to the
parallel  shocks.  As of June 30, 2004,  Farmer Mac's  effective  duration  gap,
another  standard  measure of interest rate risk that measures the expected life
of assets compared to that of liabilities,  was positive 0.6 months, compared to
minus 0.1 months as of December 31, 2003.  Duration  matching  helps to maintain
the correlation of cash flows and stable  portfolio  earnings even when interest
rates  are not  stable.  The  sensitivity  of  Farmer  Mac's MVE and NII to both
parallel  and  non-parallel  interest  rate shocks,  and its  duration  gap, are
indicators of the  effectiveness of the  Corporation's  approach to managing its
interest rate risk exposures.


     As of June 30, 2004,  Farmer Mac had $1.5 billion combined  notional amount
of interest rate swaps with terms ranging from 1 to 15 years.  Of those interest
rate swaps,  $625.3  million were  floating-to-fixed  rate  interest rate swaps,
$675.1  million  were basis  swaps and  $205.0  million  were  fixed-to-floating
interest rate swaps.

     Farmer Mac uses financial  derivatives as an end-user for hedging purposes,
not for trading or speculative  purposes.  When financial  derivatives  meet the
specific  hedge  criteria  under SFAS 133, they are accounted for as either fair
value  hedges or cash flow  hedges.  Financial  derivatives  that do not satisfy
those hedge  criteria  are not  accounted  for as hedges and changes in the fair
value of those financial derivatives are reported as a gain or loss on financial
derivatives and trading assets in the consolidated statements of operations. All
of Farmer Mac's financial  derivative  transactions are conducted under standard
collateralized  agreements that limit Farmer Mac's potential  credit exposure to
any counterparty.  As of June 30, 2004, Farmer Mac had no  uncollateralized  net
exposure to any counterparty.

     Credit Risk.  Farmer Mac's  primary  exposure to credit risk is the risk of
loss  resulting  from the  inability of  borrowers  to repay their  mortgages in
conjunction  with a deficiency  in the value of the  collateral  relative to the
amount outstanding on the mortgage and the costs of liquidation.

     Farmer Mac's  allowance  for losses is presented in four  components on its
consolidated balance sheet:

          o    an "Allowance for loan losses" on loans held for investment;
          o    a valuation  allowance on real estate owned, which is included in
               the balance  sheet under "Real  estate  owned,  net of  valuation
               allowance";
          o    an allowance for losses on loans underlying  post-1996 Act Farmer
               Mac I Guaranteed  Securities  and LTSPCs entered into or modified
               after January 1, 2003,  which is included in the balance sheet as
               a portion of the amount  reported as  "Guarantee  and  commitment
               obligation"; and
          o    an allowance for losses on loans underlying  post-1996 Act Farmer
               Mac I  Guaranteed  Securities  and LTSPCs  entered  into prior to
               January 1, 2003,  which is included  in the  balance  sheet under
               "Reserve for losses."

     Farmer Mac's  provision  for losses is presented in two  components  on its
consolidated statement of operations:

          o    a  "Provision  for  loan  losses,"  which  represents   estimated
               probable losses on Farmer Mac's loans held for investment; and
          o    a "Provision for losses,"  which  represents  estimated  probable
               losses on loans underlying  post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed
               Securities and LTSPCs and real estate owned.

     Farmer Mac estimates probable losses using a systematic process that begins
with  management's  evaluation  of the  results  of its  proprietary  loan  pool
simulation  and  guarantee  fee  model  (the  "Model").  The  Model  draws  upon
historical  information from a data set of agricultural  mortgage loans recorded
over a longer period of time than Farmer Mac's own experience to date,  screened
to include  only those  loans with  credit  characteristics  similar to those on
which Farmer Mac has assumed credit risk. The results generated by the Model are
modified by the  application of management's  judgment,  as required to take key
factors into account, including:

          o    economic conditions;
          o    geographic and agricultural  commodity  concentrations  in Farmer
               Mac's portfolio;
          o    the credit profile of Farmer Mac's portfolio;
          o    delinquency trends of Farmer Mac's portfolio;
          o    Farmer Mac's experience in the management and sale of real estate
               owned; and
          o    historical  charge-off  and recovery  activities  of Farmer Mac's
               portfolio.

     Management  believes that the general  allowance,  which is the  difference
between the total allowance for losses (generated  through use of the Model) and
the specific  allowances,  adequately covers any probable losses inherent in the
portfolio of performing loans under Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standard
No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies ("SFAS 5").

Mac's  allowance for losses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2004 and
2003:

</TABLE>

     Farmer Mac's total provision for losses was $1.6 million for second quarter
2004,  compared to $2.1 million for second  quarter 2003.  During second quarter
2004,  Farmer Mac charged off $2.0 million in losses  against the  allowance for
losses and  received  $1.8  million from two sellers (one of which was a related
party) for breaches of  representations  and  warranties  associated  with prior
sales of agricultural  mortgage loans to Farmer Mac, which amount Farmer Mac had
previously  charged  off as losses on the  associated  loans.  This  recovery is
reported as miscellaneous income. During second quarter 2003, Farmer Mac charged
off  $1.3  million  in  losses  against  the  allowance  for  losses  and had no
recoveries. The net charge-offs for second quarter 2004 and 2003 did not include
previously  accrued or advanced  interest  on loans and Farmer Mac I  Guaranteed
Securities. As of June 30, 2004, Farmer Mac's allowance for losses totaled $21.8
million,  or 45 basis points of the outstanding  principal balance of loans held
and loans  underlying  post-1996  Act Farmer  Mac I  Guaranteed  Securities  and
LTSPCs, compared to $22.1 million (44 basis points) as of December 31, 2003.

     As of June 30,  2004,  Farmer  Mac's  90-day  delinquencies  totaled  $32.8
million and represented 0.68 percent of the principal  balance of all loans held
and loans  underlying  post-1996  Act Farmer  Mac I  Guaranteed  Securities  and
LTSPCs, compared to $51.3 million (1.06 percent) as of June 30, 2003. As of June
30,  2004,   Farmer  Mac's   non-performing   assets  (which   includes   90-day
delinquencies,  loans  performing  under either their  original  loan terms or a
court-approved bankruptcy plan, and real estate owned) totaled $69.8 million and
represented  1.43 percent of the  principal  balance of all loans held and loans
underlying post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs, compared
to $80.2  million  (1.64  percent)  as of June 30,  2003.  Loans  that have been
restructured  after  delinquency were  insignificant and are included within the
reported 90-day delinquency and non-performing  asset disclosures.  From quarter
to quarter,  Farmer Mac anticipates that 90-day delinquencies and non-performing
assets will  fluctuate,  both in dollars and as a percentage of the  outstanding
portfolio,  with higher levels likely at the end of the first and third quarters
of each year corresponding to the semi-annual (January 1st and July 1st) payment
characteristics of most Farmer Mac I loans.

     The following table presents historical  information regarding Farmer Mac's
non-performing assets and 90-day delinquencies:

</TABLE>

     As of June 30, 2004,  approximately  $1.6 billion (32.2  percent) of Farmer
Mac's  outstanding  loans held and loans  underlying  post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I
Guaranteed  Securities  and LTSPCs  were in their peak  delinquency  and default
years  (approximately  years three through five after  origination)  compared to
$1.8 billion (37.1  percent) of such loans as of June 30, 2003.  The Model takes
the portfolio age distribution and maturation into  consideration.  Accordingly,
those trends did not cause  management to alter the Model's  projection  for the
provisions for losses.

     As of June 30, 2004,  Farmer Mac analyzed the following three categories of
assets for impairment, based on the fair vale of the underlying collateral:

          o    $69.8 million of non-performing assets;
          o    $32.9  million  of loans for which  Farmer Mac has  adjusted  the
               timing of  borrowers'  payment  schedules  within  the past three
               years,  but still  expects to collect all amounts due and has not
               made economic concessions; and
          o    $54.4  million  of  performing  loans that have  previously  been
               delinquent   or  are  secured  by  real   estate  that   produces
               commodities currently under stress.

Those  individual  assessments  covered  a total of  $157.1  million  of  assets
measured  for  impairment  against  updated  appraised  values,   other  updated
collateral  valuations or  discounted  values.  Of the $157.1  million of assets
analyzed, $135.8 million were adequately  collateralized.  For the $21.3 million
that  were  not  adequately  collateralized,  individual  collateral  shortfalls
totaled $2.4 million.  Accordingly,  Farmer Mac allocated specific allowances of
$2.4 million to those  under-collateralized  assets as of June 30,  2004.  As of
June   30,   2004,   after   the   allocation   of   specific    allowances   to
under-collateralized  loans,  Farmer Mac had additional  non-specific or general
allowances of $19.4  million,  bringing the total  allowance for losses to $21.8
million.

     The following table summarizes  Farmer Mac's assets  specifically  reviewed
for impairment and allowance for losses:

Liquidity and Capital Resources

     Farmer Mac has  sufficient  liquidity and capital  resources to support its
operations  for the next twelve  months and has a  contingency  funding  plan to
handle unanticipated disruptions in its access to the capital markets.

     Debt Issuance. Farmer Mac funds its program operations primarily by issuing
debt  obligations of various  maturities in the public capital  markets.  Farmer
Mac's  debt  obligations  consist  of  discount  notes  and  medium-term  notes,
including  floating rate notes,  issued to obtain funds principally to cover the
costs of  purchasing  and holding  loans and  securities  (including  Farmer Mac
Guaranteed  Securities).  Farmer Mac also issues  discount notes and medium-term
notes to obtain funds for investments, transaction costs and guarantee payments.
The interest and principal on Farmer Mac's debt are not guaranteed by and do not
constitute  debts or  obligations  of FCA or the United  States or any agency or
instrumentality  of the United  States  other than Farmer Mac.  Farmer Mac is an
institution  of the  Farm  Credit  System,  but is not  liable  for any  debt or
obligation of any other institution of the Farm Credit System. Likewise, neither
the Farm Credit System nor any other  individual  institution of the Farm Credit
System is liable  for any debt or  obligation  of Farmer  Mac.  Income on Farmer
Mac's discount notes and  medium-term  notes has no tax exemption  under federal
law from federal,  state or local taxation. The Corporation's discount notes and
medium-term notes are not currently rated by a nationally recognized statistical
rating organization  (NRSRO),  although Farmer Mac intends to obtain a rating to
eliminate  the  absence  of a rating  as a  future  point  of  contention.  (See
"Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis of Financial  Condition  and Results of
Operations--Regulatory Matters" below.)

     Farmer Mac's board of directors has  authorized  the issuance of up to $5.0
billion of  discount  notes and  medium-term  notes (of which $3.7  billion  was
outstanding as of June 30, 2004),  subject to periodic review of the adequacy of
that level relative to Farmer Mac's borrowing  requirements.  Farmer Mac invests
the proceeds of such issuances in loans,  Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities and
non-program  investment assets in accordance with guidelines  established by its
board of directors.

     Liquidity.  The  funding  and  liquidity  needs of  Farmer  Mac's  business
programs are driven by the purchase and  retention of eligible  loans and Farmer
Mac  Guaranteed  Securities,  the  maturities of Farmer Mac's discount notes and
medium-term notes and payment of principal and interest on Farmer Mac Guaranteed
Securities. Farmer Mac's primary sources of funds to meet these needs are:

          o    principal  and  interest   payments  and  ongoing  guarantee  and
               commitment   fees  received  on  loans,   Farmer  Mac  Guaranteed
               Securities and LTSPCs;
          o    principal  and  interest   payments   received  from   investment
               securities; and
          o    the issuance of discount notes and medium-term notes.

     As a result  of  Farmer  Mac's  regular  issuance  of  discount  notes  and
medium-term   notes,   as  well  as  its   status  as  a   federally   chartered
instrumentality  of the  United  States,  Farmer Mac has been able to issue debt
securities in the capital markets at favorable rates of interest. Farmer Mac has
also used  fixed-to-floating  interest  rate swaps,  combined  with  medium-term
notes, as a source of floating rate funding, and floating-to-fixed interest rate
swaps, combined with discount note issuances, as a source of fixed-rate funding.
While the swap market may  provide  favorable  fixed  rates,  swap  transactions
expose  Farmer Mac to the risk of future  widening of its own  issuance  spreads
versus  corresponding  LIBOR  rates.  If the spreads on the Farmer Mac  discount
notes  were to  increase  relative  to LIBOR,  Farmer  Mac would be exposed to a
commensurate  reduction on its net interest yield on the notional  amount of its
floating-to-fixed  interest  rate  swaps and  other  LIBOR-based  floating  rate
assets.  Farmer Mac  compensates for this risk by maintaining the flexibility to
adjust the required net yield on program  asset  purchases to reflect the change
in the discount  note to LIBOR  relationship,  as  necessary.  During the second
quarter,  Farmer Mac continued its practice of issuing floating rate notes as an
alternative to discount notes.

     For  liquidity,  Farmer Mac maintains an  investment  portfolio of cash and
cash equivalents  (including  commercial paper and other short-term money market
instruments)  and  investment  securities  consisting  mostly of  floating  rate
securities  whose rates reset within one year,  and a Farmer Mac II portfolio of
USDA Guaranteed Portions (full faith and credit of the U.S.  Government).  As of
June 30, 2004, Farmer Mac's cash and cash equivalents, investment securities and
USDA Guaranteed  Portions,  were $0.6 billion,  $1.1 billion,  and $0.7 billion,
respectively,  a  combined  60 percent  of total  liabilities.  Farmer Mac has a
policy of  maintaining a minimum of 60 days of liquidity and a target of 90 days
of  liquidity.  For second  quarter  2004,  Farmer Mac  maintained an average of
greater than 90 days of liquidity.


Regulatory Matters

     During second quarter 2004, FCA published a proposed regulation relating to
Farmer Mac's investments and liquidity,  adding administrative  requirements and
restricting  the future  composition  of the  non-program  investment  liquidity
portfolio  and its growth in  proportion  to Farmer Mac's total  guarantees  and
commitments.  Farmer Mac  believes  that the  proposed  regulation  would not be
largely  inconsistent with the Corporation's  current policies and expects to be
able to comply with the  regulation,  though  analysis  indicates it could limit
future  increases  in Farmer  Mac's  non-program  investment  portfolio  and the
related net interest  income.  Farmer Mac believes there are good and sufficient
reasons why the  proposed  regulation  should not be adopted in its current form
and, as part of the formal rule-making process, will provide written comments to
FCA within the public comment period, which on ends on September 13, 2004.

     Additionally,  on  June  10,  2004,  the  FCA  Board  approved  a  proposed
regulation  that  would  establish  a  new  risk-weight  allocation  of  capital
applicable to Farmer Mac transactions with FCS institutions,  a major segment of
Farmer  Mac's  customer  base.  The  proposed   regulation   would  require  FCS
institutions  to risk-weight  assets on their books that are guaranteed by a GSE
based on the  financial  strength  rating of the GSE, as determined by an NRSRO.
Under the proposed  regulation:  (a) the 20 percent  risk-weight  would apply to
such assets only if the GSE guarantor had a AAA or AA rating from an NRSRO;  (b)
an A rating would result in a 50 percent risk-weight; and (c) a lower rating (or
no rating)  would result in a 100 percent  risk-weight.  Farmer Mac is currently
unrated.  Currently,  all  banking  regulators  and  FCA  accord  a  20  percent
risk-weight to assets backed by guarantees of government  sponsored  enterprises
(GSEs) such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Farmer Mac.

     The proposed  regulation was published in the Federal Register on August 6,
2004, starting a 90-day public comment period. As proposed, the regulation would
require FCS  institutions to comply with the  risk-weight  allocation of capital
eighteen  months  after  the  effective  date of the  final  regulation.  If the
proposed  regulation  is adopted as a final rule in its current  form and Farmer
Mac does not receive a rating of at least AA within the period  provided  for in
the proposed  regulation,  not only would the benefit to an FCS  institution  of
doing  business  with  Farmer  Mac  be  diminished  after  the  adoption  of the
regulation,  but also,  based on the  language  of the  proposed  regulation,  a
significant  portion of the current  $2.8  billion of  outstanding  Farmer Mac I
guarantees and  commitments  currently in place with FCS  institutions  might be
subject to early termination.

     There can be no  assurance  that the  regulation  will not be  adopted as a
final rule in its current  form, or in a modified  form with  substantially  the
same effect.  Likewise,  Farmer Mac currently is not rated,  and there can be no
assurance  that  Farmer  Mac would  receive  a AAA or AA  rating  from an NRSRO.
Without regard to the proposed regulation, Farmer Mac intends to obtain a rating
from an NRSRO well before the effective date of any final regulation. Farmer Mac
believes  there are good and  sufficient  reasons  why the  proposed  regulation
should not be adopted in its current form and, as part of the formal rule-making
process,  will  provide  written  comments to FCA setting  forth those  reasons.
Farmer Mac's  comments  will include the facts that the proposed  regulation  is
inconsistent with regulations with respect to secondary market GSEs currently in
effect at other federal regulators;  that it would defeat the legislative intent
of  Congress  that Farmer Mac should be able  reliably  to increase  the lending
capacity  of all  agricultural  lenders;  and  that  its  logic  is  essentially
circular, in that Farmer Mac's financial strength would become a function of the
NRSRO's rating of its financial strength.  Always conscious of the importance of
oversight  and  sound  regulation  in the  performance  of its  mission  for the
farmers,  ranchers and rural homeowners of America,  Farmer Mac looks forward to
participating in the regulatory process as to both of the proposed regulations.


Other Matters

     On August 3, 2004 the Board of Directors adopted a policy to begin paying a
quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share on all classes of the Corporation's common
stock in the fourth  quarter of 2004,  and authorized a program to repurchase up
to ten percent of the Corporation's outstanding Class C non-voting common stock.
The Board's  decisions were made in consideration of the  Corporation's  forward
capital  requirements to support fulfillment of its mission of providing greater
liquidity  and lending  capacity to  agricultural  lenders  and  increasing  the
availability of capital markets-based funding for mortgage loans to the Nation's
farmers,  ranchers and rural homeowners.  The Board determined that Farmer Mac's
capital  was more than  sufficient  to meet those  requirements.  Likewise,  the
Board's  decisions gave due regard to Farmer Mac's level of excess capital above
both statutory minimum and risk-based capital  requirements,  66 percent and 391
percent,  respectively,  and the annuity-like nature of the Corporation's income
streams.

     Considering  recent market price levels of Class C common stock,  the Board
concluded  that the  repurchase  program  would  enable  Farmer Mac to reacquire
shares at prices inconsistent with the Board's and management's positive view of
the Corporation's long-term business outlook. Under the program, Farmer Mac will
use a broker-dealer  as  repurchasing  agent to acquire shares from time to time
over the next 2 years  through  open market  transactions,  block  purchases  or
private  transactions.  The timing of  purchases  and the number of shares to be
purchased  will  depend on market  conditions.  The plan does not  obligate  the
Corporation to acquire any specific  number of shares and may be discontinued at
any time.  Farmer Mac intends to fund such repurchases with currently  available
working capital. Shares repurchased under the program will become authorized but
unissued shares available for future issuance, as determined by the Board.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

     Farmer Mac is exposed to market  risk  attributable  to changes in interest
rates.  Farmer Mac manages this market risk by entering  into various  financial
transactions, including financial derivatives, and by monitoring its exposure to
changes  in  interest  rates.  See  "Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of
Financial  Condition  and Results of  Operations--Quantitative  and  Qualitative
Disclosures  About  Market  Risk   Management--Interest   Rate  Risk"  for  more
information  about Farmer Mac's exposure to interest rate risk and strategies to
manage such risk. For information  regarding  Farmer Mac's use of and accounting
policies for financial derivatives,  see Note 1(c) to the condensed consolidated
financial  statements.  See  "Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition  and  Results of  Operations--Liquidity  and  Capital  Resources"  for
further information regarding Farmer Mac's debt issuance and liquidity risks.


Item 4. Controls and Procedures

     Farmer Mac maintains  disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed in the Corporation's  periodic filings
under the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"),  including this
report, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis. These
disclosure  controls and procedures include controls and procedures  designed to
ensure that  information  required to be  disclosed  under the  Exchange  Act is
accumulated and communicated to the  Corporation's  management on a timely basis
to allow decisions regarding required  disclosure.  Farmer Mac's Chief Executive
Officer and Chief  Financial  Officer have  evaluated the  effectiveness  of the
design and operation of the Corporation's disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined under Rules  13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of June 30,
2004. Based upon that evaluation, Farmer Mac's Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer have concluded that the Corporation's  disclosure controls and
procedures  are adequate  and  effective.  For the quarter  ended June 30, 2004,
there were no significant changes in Farmer Mac's internal controls, or in other
factors that could materially  affect these controls,  subsequent to the date of
their  evaluation,  including any corrective  actions with regard to significant
deficiencies or material weaknesses.
