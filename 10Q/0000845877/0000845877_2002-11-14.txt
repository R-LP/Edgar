Item 1. Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

     The following interim condensed  consolidated  financial  statements of the
Federal  Agricultural  Mortgage  Corporation ("Farmer Mac" or the "Corporation")
have been prepared,  without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the
Securities  and Exchange  Commission.  These  condensed  consolidated  financial
statements reflect all normal and recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion
of  management,  necessary  to present a fair  statement  of the results for the

Note 1.  Accounting Policies

(a)   Cash and Cash Equivalents

     Farmer Mac considers  highly  liquid  investment  securities  with original
maturities  of  three  months  or less to be cash  equivalents.  Changes  in the
balance of cash and cash equivalents are reported in the Condensed  Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows. The following table sets forth  information  regarding
certain cash and non-cash  transactions  for the nine months ended September 30,
2002 and 2001.

</TABLE>

(b)   Loans

     As of September 30, 2002,  loans held by Farmer Mac included  $37.0 million
held for sale and $841.8 million held for  investment.  As of December 31, 2001,
loans held by Farmer Mac included $25.8 million held for sale and $173.6 million
held for  investment.  Detailed  information  regarding  the  allowance for loan
losses is presented in Note 1(c).

            (c)  Allowance for Losses

     As of September 30, 2002,  Farmer Mac maintained a $19.1 million  allowance
for losses to cover estimated  probable losses on loans held, real estate owned,
and loans underlying  securities guaranteed by Farmer Mac under the Farmer Mac I
program  after the 1996  revision  to its charter  ("Post-1996  Act Farmer Mac I
Guaranteed  Securities") and Long-Term Standby Purchase Commitments  ("LTSPCs").
(See  Note 2 for a  description  of  LTSPCs.)  In  estimating  probable  losses,
management  considers  factors  such  as  economic  conditions,  geographic  and
agricultural  commodity  concentrations,  the credit  profile of the  portfolio,
delinquency trends and historical charge-off and recovery activity and evaluates
the results of its  proprietary  Loan Pool Simulation and Guarantee  Model.  The
allowance  is  increased  through  periodic  provisions  charged to expense  and
reduced by charge-offs for actual losses, net of recoveries.

     The table below summarizes the three components of the allowance for losses
as of September 30, 2002 and December 31, 2001.

</TABLE>

     For the period  ended  September  30,  2002,  Farmer Mac  reclassified  the
portion of its allowance for losses  attributed  to its  on-balance  sheet loans
held for  investment  as a  contra-asset  account on the balance  sheet  labeled
"Allowance for loan losses." Farmer Mac also reclassified the specific valuation
allowance  attributed to its real estate owned as a contra-asset  account on the
balance sheet that is included  within the line item labeled "Real estate owned,
net of valuation allowance." Reclassifications of the allowance for losses as of
December 31, 2001 were made to conform to the current period presentation. These
reclassifications  are for presentation  purposes only and have no impact on the
Corporation's risk exposure or financial position.

     Farmer Mac's  provision for losses was $2.0 million for third quarter 2002,
compared to $2.0 million for third  quarter  2001.  During third  quarter  2002,
Farmer Mac charged off $1.5 million in losses  against the  allowance for losses
and  recovered  $0.3  million  from  previously  charged  off  losses,  for  net
charge-offs of $1.2 million. Net charge-offs for the nine months ended September
30, 2002 were $2.8 million.  The net  charge-offs for third quarter and the nine
months ended  September 30, 2002 included $0.4 million and $0.6 million  related
to  previously   accrued  or  advanced  interest  on  Farmer  Mac  I  Guaranteed
Securities,  compared to $0.2  million and $0.4  million for the same periods in
2001.

     No  allowance  for losses has been made for loans  underlying  Farmer Mac I
Guaranteed  Securities  issued prior to the 1996 Act or securities  issued under
the Farmer Mac II program ("Farmer Mac II Guaranteed Securities").  Farmer Mac I
Guaranteed Securities issued prior to the 1996 Act are supported by unguaranteed
first loss  subordinated  interests,  which are expected to exceed the estimated
credit losses on those loans. Guaranteed Portions  collateralizing Farmer Mac II
Guaranteed  Securities  are  guaranteed  by  the  United  States  Department  of
Agriculture  ("USDA") and are obligations backed by the full faith and credit of
the United  States.  Farmer Mac has  experienced  no losses on any  pre-1996 Act
Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities or on any Farmer Mac II Guaranteed Securities
and does not expect to incur any such losses in the future.

     A  financial  derivative  is a  financial  instrument  that has one or more
underlyings and one or more notional  amounts,  requires no significant  initial
net  investment,  and has terms that require net  settlement.  Farmer Mac enters
into financial derivative contracts as an end-user for hedging purposes, not for
trading or  speculative  purposes.  Farmer Mac enters  into  interest  rate swap
contracts  principally to adjust the  characteristics  of its short-term debt to
match more closely the cash flow and duration characteristics of its longer-term
mortgage  and  other  assets,  and also to  adjust  the  characteristics  of its
long-term debt to match more closely the cash flow and duration  characteristics
of  its  short-term   assets,   thereby  reducing   interest  rate  risk.  These
transactions  also provide an overall  lower  effective  cost of borrowing  than
would otherwise be available in the conventional debt market.

     When financial derivatives meet the specific hedge criteria of Statement of
Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative  Instruments
and Hedging Activities ("SFAS 133"), they are accounted for as either fair value
hedges or cash flow  hedges.  Financial  derivatives  that do not satisfy  those
hedge criteria are not accounted for as hedges and changes in the fair values of
those financial derivatives are reported in income or expense.

     Net after-tax  charges against earnings under SFAS 133 during third quarter
2002 totaled $0.9 million, and the net after-tax decrease to other comprehensive
income  totaled  $19.0  million.  Substantially  all of this amount  represented
changes  in the fair  values  of  forward  sale  contracts,  interest  rate swap
contracts and settled  forward sale contracts  using fair values as of September
30, 2002. As of September 30, 2002, Farmer Mac had  approximately  $45.8 million
of net after-tax  unrealized  losses on cash flow hedges included in accumulated
other comprehensive  income. These amounts will be reclassified into earnings in
the same  period or  periods  during  which the hedged  forecasted  transactions
(issuance of fixed-rate  funding) affect earnings or immediately when it becomes
probable that the original hedged  forecasted  transaction will not occur within
two months of the originally specified date. In accordance with SFAS 133, Farmer
Mac estimates that $0.7 million of the amount currently  reported in accumulated
other  comprehensive  income will be reclassified  into earnings within the next
twelve months. For the quarter ended September 30, 2002, the  ineffectiveness of
designated hedges included in Farmer Mac's net income was immaterial.

     SFAS 133 also required, as the change in the fair value of a hedged item, a
$0.5 million decrease in the line item "Farmer Mac guaranteed securities" on the
balance  sheet for third  quarter  2002.  For the year ended 2001,  the recorded
change in the fair value of a hedged item was a $0.3 million increase in "Farmer
Mac guaranteed securities."

     (e) Earnings Per Common Share

     Basic earnings per common share are based on the weighted-average number of
common shares  outstanding.  Diluted  earnings per common share are based on the
weighted-average  number of common  shares  outstanding  adjusted to include all
potentially  dilutive common stock options.  The following  schedule  reconciles
basic and diluted  earnings per common share for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2002 and 2001:

     (f) Preferred Stock

     On May 6, 2002 the  Corporation  issued 700,000 shares of 6.40%  Cumulative
Preferred  Stock,  Series  A,  which  has a  redemption  price  and  liquidation
preference  of $50.00 per share,  plus accrued and unpaid  dividends  ("Series A
Preferred  Stock").  The Series A Preferred Stock does not have a maturity date.
Beginning  on June 30,  2012,  Farmer  Mac has the option to redeem the Series A
Preferred  Stock at any time,  in whole or in part, at the  redemption  price of
$50.00 per share,  plus accrued and unpaid  dividends  through and including the
redemption  date.  Farmer  Mac will pay  cumulative  dividends  on the  Series A
Preferred  Stock  quarterly  in  arrears,  when and if  declared by the Board of
Directors.  The costs of issuing  the Series A Preferred  Stock were  charged to
additional paid-in capital.

     On August 1, 2002,  Farmer Mac's Board of Directors  declared a dividend of
$0.80 per share on the Series A Preferred Stock for the period from July 1, 2002
to September 30, 2002, which was paid on September 27, 2002.

     (g) Reclassifications

     Certain  reclassifications of prior period information were made to conform
to the current  period  presentation.  As a result of the continued  increase in
loans held for  investment  and to further  clarify  the various  components  of
Farmer  Mac's  allowance  for losses  (previously  referred  to as  reserve  for
losses),  Farmer Mac reclassified certain components of its allowance for losses
during the quarter ended September 30, 2002.  Farmer Mac also  reclassified  its
December 31, 2001  presentation  of the  allowance  for losses to conform to the
current   period    presentation.    The   following   table    summarizes   the
reclassifications  on the  September 30, 2002 balance  sheet  information  under
prior period  classification  and the current  presentation  to demonstrate  the
effects of the reclassifications.

     (h) New Accounting Standards

     In April 2002, the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board ("FASB")  issued
Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  145,  Rescission  of  FASB
Statements  No. 4, 44 and 64,  Amendment of FASB  Statement No. 13 and Technical
Corrections ("SFAS 145"). Effective January 1, 2003, SFAS 145 requires gains and
losses  from  the  extinguishment  or  repurchase  of debt to be  classified  as
extraordinary  items only if they meet the criteria for such  classification  in
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30, Reporting the Results of Operations,
Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business and  Extraordinary,
Unusual and Infrequently  Occurring  Events and  Transactions  ("APB 30"). Until
January 1, 2003, gains and losses from the  extinguishment or repurchase of debt
must be classified as  extraordinary  items.  After January 1, 2003, any gain or
loss resulting from the  extinguishment  or repurchase of debt  classified as an
extraordinary  item in a prior  period that does not meet the  criteria for such
classification under APB 30 must be reclassified.

     Note 2. Off-Balance Sheet Program Activities

     Farmer Mac  provides a secondary  market for  agricultural  mortgage  loans
eligible  for the Farmer Mac I program by:  purchasing  eligible  loans for cash
through its "cash window"; guaranteeing securities backed by eligible loans; and
committing to purchase eligible loans for securitization. To be eligible for any
Farmer Mac I secondary market  transaction,  a loan must meet the  Corporation's
credit underwriting,  appraisal and documentation standards. Farmer Mac believes
the  credit  risk it assumes in each of these  three  alternatives  is the same.
Farmer Mac further considers the effects of all on- and off-balance sheet Farmer
Mac I program activities on its overall portfolio diversification.

     Farmer Mac offers  approved  agricultural  and rural  residential  mortgage
lenders  ("Sellers") two Farmer Mac I off-balance sheet alternatives to increase
their  liquidity or lending  capacity while  retaining the cash flow benefits of
their loans.

     o    The first  alternative  is a swap  transaction,  in which  Farmer  Mac
          acquires  eligible  loans from  Sellers in  exchange  for Farmer Mac I
          Guaranteed  Securities  backed by such  loans.  In  consideration  for
          Farmer Mac's  assumption  of the credit risk on loans  underlying  the
          Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities  issued in connection with a swap,
          Farmer Mac receives an annual guarantee fee on the outstanding balance
          of the Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities.

     o    The second  alternative is an LTSPC, which is not a guarantee of loans
          or securities,  but is a commitment by Farmer Mac to purchase eligible
          loans from Sellers on an  undetermined  future date. In  consideration
          for Farmer Mac's  assumption of the credit risk on loans underlying an
          LTSPC,  Farmer Mac  receives an annual  commitment  fee  (included  in
          guarantee  fees in the  Consolidated  Statements of Operations) on the
          outstanding  balance of those  loans,  at a level  approximating  what
          would have been the guarantee fee in a swap.

     A swap or an LTSPC may involve  loans with  payment,  maturity and interest
rate  characteristics  that differ from those purchased through the cash window.
Like a swap,  an LTSPC  permits  a Seller  to  nominate  from  its  portfolio  a
segregated pool of loans,  subject to review by Farmer Mac for conformance  with
its standards.  Upon Farmer Mac's  acceptance of the conforming  loans,  whether
under a swap or an LTSPC,  the Seller  effectively  transfers the credit risk on
those  loans to Farmer  Mac,  thereby  reducing  its  credit  and  concentration
exposures and,  consequently,  its regulatory capital  requirements and its loss
reserve requirements.  Only the LTSPC structure,  however, permits the Seller to
retain the segregated loans in its portfolio. Unlike a swap, in which Farmer Mac
I Guaranteed  Securities  backed by those loans are delivered to the Seller,  an
LTSPC commits Farmer Mac to future purchase of loans in that pool of loans based
upon Farmer Mac's original credit review of those loans: (a) at par plus accrued
interest,  if the loans become four months  delinquent;  (b) at a mark-to-market
price,  if the  loans are not  delinquent  and are  standard  cash  window  loan
products;  (c) at a negotiated  price for all loans in the pool, if they are not
four  months  delinquent;  or  (d)  in  exchange  for  Farmer  Mac I  Guaranteed
Securities issued to the Seller in a swap transaction.

     In addition to swaps and LTSPCs,  Farmer Mac's off-balance sheet activities
include  the  guarantee  of Farmer  Mac  Guaranteed  Securities  issued  through
mortgage-backed  securities trusts to third-party  investors in publicly offered
transactions registered under the Securities Act of 1933.

     The  following  table  presents  the  balance  of  outstanding  LTSPCs  and
off-balance sheet Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities as of September 30, 2002 and
December 31, 2001:

     As of September 30, 2002:

          o    the  weighted-average  remaining  maturity for all loans held and
               loans underlying on- and off-balance  sheet Farmer Mac Guaranteed
               Securities and LTSPCs was 13.7 years;

          o    the weighted-average  remaining maturity for all loans underlying
               off-balance sheet Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs was
               15.0 years;

          o    the  weighted-average  remaining maturity of all loans underlying
               off-balance sheet Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs was
               12.5 years and 15.3 years, respectively;

          o    the  weighted-average  remaining  maturity for all loans held and
               loans   underlying   on-balance   sheet  Farmer  Mac   Guaranteed
               Securities was 12.1 years; and

          o    the range of  remaining  maturities  for all loans held and loans
               underlying  on-  and  off-balance  sheet  Farmer  Mac  I  and  II
               activities, including LTSPCs, was 1 month to 38 years (the amount
               with remaining  maturities greater than 30 years had an aggregate
               outstanding balance of $2.6 million,  consisting entirely of USDA
               guaranteed portions of adjustable rate loans).

     Farmer Mac's policy for  recognizing  revenue from guarantee fees on Farmer
Mac Guaranteed  Securities and commitment fees on LTSPCs is to recognize them on
an accrual basis over the life of the  underlying  loans.  As such, no guarantee
fees or  commitment  fees are unearned at the end of any  reporting  period.  If
Farmer Mac  purchases  a  delinquent  loan  underlying  a Farmer Mac  Guaranteed
Security or an LTSPC,  Farmer Mac stops accruing the guarantee or commitment fee
upon the loan  purchase.  If the loan becomes  current and is repurchased by the
Seller under the terms of the LTSPC, Farmer Mac resumes accrual of the fee.

     Note 3. Comprehensive Income

     Comprehensive  income  (loss) is comprised of net income plus other changes
in  stockholders'  equity not resulting from  investments by or distributions to
stockholders. The following table sets forth comprehensive income (loss) for the
three and nine  months  ended  September  30,  2002 and  2001.  The  changes  in
unrealized  gains  on  securities  available-for-sale  are  net of  the  related
deferred tax expense of $13.2  million and $19.6  million for the three and nine
months  ended  September  30,  2002,  respectively,  and $15.1  million and $2.7
million for the three and nine months ended  September 30, 2001.  The changes in
the fair value of the financial  derivatives  classified as cash flow hedges for
the three and nine months  ended  September  30,  2002 are net of  deferred  tax
benefit of $10.2 million and $16.3 million,  respectively,  and $7.8 million and
$7.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2001.

Item 2. Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
        of Operations

Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

     Certain statements made in this Form 10-Q are "forward-looking  statements"
within  the  meaning of the  Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform Act of 1995
pertaining  to  management's  current  expectations  as to Farmer  Mac's  future
financial results, business prospects and business developments. Forward-looking
statements  include,  without  limitation,   any  statement  that  may  predict,
forecast,  indicate or imply future results,  performance or  achievements,  and
typically are accompanied by, and identified with, such terms as  "anticipates,"
"believes,"  "expects,"  "intends," "should" and similar phrases.  The following
management's  discussion  and  analysis  includes   forward-looking   statements
addressing  Farmer Mac's  prospects  for  earnings and growth in loan  purchase,
guarantee,  LTSPC and securitization  volume;  trends in net interest income and
provision  for  losses;  changes in capital  position;  and other  business  and
financial matters.

      Management's expectations for Farmer Mac's future necessarily involve a
number of assumptions, estimates and the evaluation of risks and uncertainties.
Various factors could cause Farmer Mac's actual results or events to differ
materially from the expectations as expressed or implied by the forward-looking
statements, including uncertainties regarding:

     o    the rate and  direction of  development  of the  secondary  market for
          agricultural mortgage loans;

     o    the possible  establishment  of  additional  statutory  or  regulatory
          restrictions on Farmer Mac;

     o    substantial  changes in  interest  rates,  agricultural  land  values,
          commodity prices, export demand for U.S. agricultural products and the
          general economy;

     o    protracted  adverse  weather,  market  or other  conditions  affecting
          particular  geographic  regions or particular  commodities  related to
          agricultural   mortgage   loans   backing   Farmer  Mac  I  Guaranteed
          Securities;

     o    legislative or regulatory  developments or  interpretations  of Farmer
          Mac's statutory  charter that could adversely affect Farmer Mac or the
          ability of certain lenders to participate in its programs or the terms
          of any such participation;

     o    Farmer Mac's continuing  access to the debt markets at favorable rates
          and terms;

     o    the possible effect of the risk-based capital requirement which could,
          under certain  circumstances,  be in excess of the  statutory  minimum
          capital level;

     o    the  outcome of the  pending  analysis  of Farmer  Mac by the  General
          Accounting Office;

     o    the rate of growth in agricultural mortgage indebtedness;

     o    the size of the agricultural mortgage market;

     o    borrower    preferences   for   fixed-rate    agricultural    mortgage
          indebtedness;

     o    the  willingness of lenders to sell  agricultural  mortgage loans into
          the Farmer Mac secondary market;

     o    the willingness of investors to invest in agricultural mortgage-backed
          securities;

     o    competition in the  origination or purchase of  agricultural  mortgage
          loans  and  the  sale  of   agricultural   mortgage-backed   and  debt
          securities;

     o    the effects on the  agricultural  economy of the  government  payments
          that are  provided  for in the Farm Bill signed into law May 13, 2002;
          or

     o    changes in Farmer Mac's status as a government-sponsored enterprise.

     The foregoing factors are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report may
include additional factors that could adversely affect Farmer Mac's business and
its financial  performance.  Furthermore,  new risk factors  emerge from time to
time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor
assess the  effects of such  factors on Farmer  Mac's  business or the extent to
which any factor, or combination of factors,  may cause actual results to differ
materially  from the  expectations  expressed or implied by the  forward-looking
statements.  In light of  these  potential  risks  and  uncertainties,  no undue
reliance should be placed on any  forward-looking  statements  expressed in this
report. Furthermore, Farmer Mac undertakes no obligation to release publicly the
results  of  revisions  to any  forward-looking  statements  that may be made to
reflect any future events or circumstances  except as otherwise  mandated by the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

     The  preparation  of our  financial  results of  operations  and  financial
position  require us to make estimates and  assumptions  that affect the amounts
reported in these condensed  consolidated financial statements and related notes
for the periods  presented,  and actual results could differ from our estimates.
The critical  accounting  policy that is both  important to the portrayal of our
financial condition and requires complex, subjective judgments is the accounting
policy for Farmer Mac's allowance for losses (previously  referred to as reserve
for losses).  The allowance  for losses is presented in three  components on the
consolidated balance sheet:

     o    an "Allowance for loan losses" on loans held for investment;

     o    a valuation  allowance on real estate owned,  which is included in the
          balance sheet under "Real estate owned,  net of valuation  allowance";
          and

     o    an allowance for losses on loans underlying Post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I
          Guaranteed  Securities  and  LTSPCs,  which is included in the balance
          sheet under "Reserve for losses."

During the quarter ended  September 30, 2002,  Farmer Mac  reclassified  certain
components of its allowance for losses to further  clarify the  presentation  of
the  allowance for losses.  See Note 1(c) and (g) to the condensed  consolidated
financial statements for additional information.

     The purpose of the allowance for losses is to provide for estimated  losses
that are  probable to have  occurred as of the  balance  sheet date,  and not to
predict or  account  for  future  potential  losses.  The  determination  of the
allowance for losses requires management to make significant  estimates based on
information  available as of the balance  sheet date,  including the amounts and
timing of losses and current market and economic conditions. These estimates are
subject to change in future reporting periods if such conditions and information
change.  For  example,  a  continued  decline in the  national  or  agricultural
economies could result in an increase in delinquencies  or  foreclosures,  which
may require additional allowances for losses in future periods.

     Farmer Mac  maintains an allowance for losses to cover  estimated  probable
losses on its loans held for investment,  real estate owned and loans underlying
Post-1996  Act Farmer Mac I  Guaranteed  Securities  and LTSPCs.  In  estimating
probable  losses,  management  considers  factors  such as economic  conditions,
geographic and agricultural commodity concentrations,  the credit profile of the
portfolio,  delinquency  trends and historical  charge-off and recovery activity
and evaluates the results of its proprietary  Loan Pool Simulation and Guarantee
Model. The allowance is increased through periodic provisions for losses charged
to expense and reduced by charge-offs for actual losses, net of recoveries.

     No  allowance  for losses has been made for loans  underlying  Farmer Mac I
Guaranteed  Securities  issued prior to the 1996 Act or Farmer Mac II Guaranteed
Securities.  Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities issued prior to the 1996 Act are
supported by unguaranteed first loss subordinated interests,  which are expected
to exceed  the  estimated  credit  losses on those  loans.  Guaranteed  Portions
collateralizing  Farmer Mac II Guaranteed  Securities are guaranteed by the USDA
and are  obligations  backed by the full faith and credit of the United  States.
Farmer Mac has experienced no losses on any pre-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed
Securities or on any Farmer Mac II Guaranteed  Securities and does not expect to
incur any such losses in the future.

     Further  information  regarding  the allowance for losses is included in "-
Risk Management - Credit Risk."

Results of Operations

     Overview.  Net income  available to common  stockholders  for third quarter
2002,  was $5.0  million or $0.42 per  diluted  common  share  compared  to $4.9
million or $0.41 per diluted common share for third quarter 2001.

     Farmer Mac's revenue growth continued in third quarter 2002, reflecting the
effects of outstanding  guarantee  volume as of September 30, 2002 that was more
than $1.2 billion  higher than at the close of third  quarter 2001 and increased
net  interest   income  due  to  a  higher   average  net   interest   yield  on
interest-earning  assets.  During third quarter 2002, Farmer Mac: o added $140.2
million of Farmer Mac I eligible loans under LTSPCs;  o purchased  $58.5 million
of newly  originated  Farmer Mac I eligible loans; and o purchased $37.4 million
of Farmer Mac II Guaranteed Portions of loans guaranteed by USDA.

     USDA is currently forecasting net cash income on farms for 2002 to be $50.8
billion,  which includes  government  payments of $17.0 billion.  In 2001, $20.7
billion in government payments were made to the agricultural sector and net cash
income on farms was $59.7 billion.  According to USDA,  much of the net decrease
in  forecasted  net cash income on farms for 2002  compared to 2001 results from
the record  livestock  receipts during 2001,  which are anticipated to return to
more normal levels in 2002.  USDA  currently  expects farm real estate values to
rise during 2002 by about one percent.  Regionally,  farm real estate values may
vary  with  differing  rates  of  increase,  or  even  decrease,   depending  on
commodities grown and regional economic factors.

     Set forth below is a more  detailed  discussion  of Farmer Mac's results of
operations.

     Net  Interest  Income.  Net  interest  income was $10.0  million  for third
quarter 2002 and $26.3 million year-to-date,  compared to $7.9 million and $19.7
million for the same  periods in 2001.  The net interest  yield,  which does not
include guarantee fees for loans purchased prior to April 1, 2001 (the effective
date of Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 140,  Accounting  for
Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and  Extinguishments  of Liabilities
("SFAS 140")), was 95 basis points for year-to-date  2002,  compared to 82 basis
points for year-to-date  2001. The net interest yields for year-to-date 2002 and
year-to-date  2001  included  the benefits of yield  maintenance  payments of 10
basis points and 9 basis points,  respectively.  The income  realized from yield
maintenance payments is, in effect, the accelerated present value of an expected
future interest income stream,  which,  in turn,  leads to slightly  reduced net
interest  income in future  reporting  periods.  Because  the timing and size of
these payments varies greatly, variations should not be considered indicative of
positive or negative trends to gauge future financial results. The effect of the
adoption of SFAS 140 was a  reclassification  of  approximately  $1.3 million (4
basis  points) of guarantee fee income as interest  income for the  year-to-date
2002. Adjusted for the effects of yield maintenance and excluding the effects of
SFAS 140, the net interest yields for year-to-date  2002 and  year-to-date  2001
were 81 basis points and 73 basis points, respectively.

     The following table provides information regarding the average balances and
rates of interest-earning assets and funding for the nine months ended September
30, 2002 and 2001. The balance of non-accruing  loans is included in the average
balance  of  interest  earning  loans  presented,  though no  related  income is
included in the income figures presented. The decreases in the average rates for
cash and cash equivalents  reflect their short-term nature. The decreases in the
average rates for  investments  and loans and Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities
reflect the  relatively  large  proportion  of  adjustable  rates in those asset
categories  (74  percent of  investments  and 59 percent of loans and Farmer Mac
Guaranteed Securities). The decrease in the average rate for discount notes also
reflects their short-term  nature. The decreases in all of these rates track the
general decrease in market rates between the two periods.

     The  following  table sets forth  information  regarding the changes in the
components of Farmer Mac's net interest  income for the periods  indicated.  For
each  category,  information is provided on changes  attributable  to changes in
volume (change in volume  multiplied by old rate) and changes in rate (change in
rate  multiplied  by old  volume).  Combined  rate/volume  variances,  the third
element of the  calculation,  are allocated  based on their  relative  size. The
decreases due to rate reflect the  short-term or  adjustable-rate  nature of the
assets or liabilities and the general decreases in market rates described above.

     Other  Income.  Other  income,  which is comprised of guarantee  fee income
(which  includes  commitment  fee income on LTSPCs)  and  miscellaneous  income,
totaled  $5.3 million for third  quarter  2002  compared to $4.3 million for the
same period in 2001.  Guarantee  fee  income,  the  largest  component  of other
income,  was $4.9 million for third quarter  2002,  compared to $4.2 million for
third quarter 2001.  The relative  increase in guarantee fee income  reflects an
increase in the average balance of outstanding guarantees and LTSPCs.  Excluding
the  effects  of the  adoption  of SFAS 140 that  reclassified  $0.6  million of
guarantee fee income as interest  income,  guarantee fees for third quarter 2002
would have been $5.5 million.  The  difference  or "spread"  between the cost of
Farmer  Mac's debt funding for loans and  Post-1996  Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed
Securities  held on its books and the yield on those  assets is  composed of one
component that  compensates for credit risk, which would continue to be received
by Farmer Mac as a guarantee fee if the assets were sold, and another  component
that compensates for interest rate risk,  which would not typically  continue to
be  received by Farmer Mac (except to the extent  attributable  to any  retained
interest-only  strip) if the asset  were  sold.  Miscellaneous  income  was $0.5
million for third quarter 2002, compared to $0.1 million for third quarter 2001.

     Expenses.  During  third  quarter  2002,  operating  expenses  totaled $3.9
million,  compared  to $2.5  million for third  quarter  2001.  The  increase in
operating  expenses in third  quarter  2002  primarily  reflects  higher  legal,
consulting  and  regulatory  fees.  In  addition  to  the  estimated  additional
regulatory   costs   incurred   during  third  quarter  2002,  the  Farm  Credit
Administration ("FCA"), the federal agency with direct regulatory authority over
Farmer Mac, has advised Farmer Mac that its regulatory assessment for October 1,
2002 through  September 30, 2003 will be an estimated $1.4 million,  an increase
from the estimated $0.7 million for October 1, 2001 through  September 30, 2002.
Farmer Mac expects that legal and  consulting  fees will continue at the current
increased  level of  approximately  $300,000 to $400,000  per quarter  above the
prior level until the effects of certain  inaccurate  and  misleading  publicity
about Farmer Mac have dissipated, which we believe will not occur until sometime
after the General Accounting Office ("GAO") completes and releases its report of
its analysis of Farmer Mac (see "Other Matters" below for further information on
the GAO's analysis of Farmer Mac). At this time, we are not certain when the GAO
will complete or release its report.  Farmer Mac expects that, when such effects
have  dissipated,  legal  and  consulting  fees  will  continue  at a  level  of
approximately  $100,000 to $150,000 per quarter  above the prior level to assure
compliance  with the new  statutory  and  regulatory  requirements  relating  to
corporate governance.

     Farmer Mac's  provision  for losses was $2.0 million for third quarter 2002
and $6.1 million for the nine months ending September 30, 2002, compared to $2.0
million and $4.7 million for the same periods in 2001. (See "- Risk  Management,
- Credit Risk" for  additional  information.)  As of September 30, 2002,  Farmer
Mac's total  allowance  for losses  totaled  $19.1  million,  or 0.42 percent of
outstanding loans held or loans underlying Post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed
Securities  and LTSPCS,  compared to $15.9 million (0.45 percent) as of December
31, 2001 and $14.7 million (0.44 percent) as of September 30, 2001.

     The  provision for income taxes totaled $2.3 million for third quarter 2002
compared to $2.5 million for the same period in 2001. Farmer Mac's effective tax
rate for third quarter 2002 was 29.5 percent, compared to 33.3 percent for third
quarter  2001.  The  reduction in the effective tax rate reflects the effects of
certain tax-advantaged investment securities.

     Extraordinary Gain. During second quarter 2002, Farmer Mac recognized a net
after-tax  extraordinary  gain of $0.6 million  resulting from the repurchase of
$18.9 million of outstanding Farmer Mac debt that had a maturity date of October
14, 2011 and an interest rate of 5.4 percent.  During first quarter 2002, Farmer
Mac recognized a net after-tax extraordinary gain of $1.6 million resulting from
the  repurchase  of $43.8  million  of  outstanding  Farmer  Mac debt that had a
maturity  date of October 14, 2011 and an interest  rate of 5.4  percent.  These
debt securities  were replaced with new fixed-rate  funding to the same maturity
dates  at  more  attractive   interest  rates,   which  preserves  Farmer  Mac's
asset-liability match and reduces future interest expense.

     Effects of SFAS 133.  SFAS 133  requires  the change in the fair  values of
certain financial derivatives to be reflected in the Corporation's net income or
other comprehensive income. Management believes that reporting results excluding
the  cumulative  effects of the change in  accounting  principles  recognized on
January 1, 2001 under SFAS 133,  and its ongoing  effects  during the  reporting
periods,  provides  meaningful  operating  measures  of Farmer  Mac's  financial
performance.  Such  information  is presented to  supplement,  not replace,  net
income,  net  income  available  to  common  stockholders,  revenues,  cash from
operations or any other operating or liquidity  performance  measures prescribed
by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

     For third quarter 2002, the net effects of SFAS 133 on net income available
to common  stockholders was a reduction of approximately $0.9 million,  or $0.07
per diluted common share,  compared to $0.1 million, or $0.01 per diluted share,
for third quarter 2001. The following  table presents the effects of SFAS 133 on
net income  available to common  stockholders  and  earnings per diluted  common
share.

     Business  Volume.  Farmer Mac purchases  eligible loans or USDA  guaranteed
portions of loans,  securitizes  those loans and guarantees  timely  payments of
principal  and  interest on  securities  backed by those  loans.  Farmer Mac may
retain those  securities in its portfolio or sell them to third parties  through
the capital  markets.  Farmer Mac also enters into LTSPCs for eligible loans and
exchanges  of  Farmer  Mac  Guaranteed  Securities  for  eligible  loans or USDA
guaranteed portions of loans ("swaps").

     o    Farmer Mac's  purchases of eligible loans and guarantees of securities
          backed by those  loans are part of the Farmer  Mac I program  (whether
          the securities are retained by Farmer Mac or sold);

     o    Farmer  Mac's  purchases  of USDA  guaranteed  portions  of loans  and
          guarantees of securities backed by those guaranteed  portions are part
          of the Farmer Mac II program  (whether the  securities are retained by
          Farmer Mac or sold);

     o    Farmer Mac's  commitments  through  LTSPCs,  which may include  either
          newly  originated or seasoned  eligible loans,  are part of the Farmer
          Mac I program; and

     o    Farmer Mac enters  into swaps  under both the Farmer Mac I program and
          the  Farmer  Mac II  program,  with swaps  involving  USDA  guaranteed
          portions  of loans  included  in the Farmer  Mac II program  and swaps
          involving  all other  eligible  loans  included  in the  Farmer  Mac I

     The purchase  price of newly  originated  and seasoned  eligible  loans and
portfolios  purchased  by Farmer Mac through the cash window (none of which were
delinquent  at the time of purchase)  is the fair value based on current  market
interest  rates and Farmer Mac's target net yield,  which  includes an amount to
compensate  Farmer Mac for  credit  risk that is  similar  to the  guarantee  or
commitment  fee it  receives  for  accepting  credit  risk on  loans  underlying
Post-1996  Act  Farmer  Mac I  Guaranteed  Securities  and  LTSPCs.  As  part of
fulfilling its guarantee  obligations for Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities and
assumption of credit risk on commitments to purchase  eligible loans  underlying
LTSPCs, Farmer Mac purchases defaulted loans (all of which were at least 90 days
delinquent  at the time of  purchase)  out of those  securities  and pools.  The
purchase  price for  defaulted  loans  purchased  out of Farmer Mac I Guaranteed
Securities is the current outstanding principal balance of the loan plus accrued
and unpaid  interest.  The purchase price for defaulted loans purchased under an
LTSPC is the current outstanding principal balance of the loan, with accrued and
unpaid  interest on the defaulted  loans payable out of any future loan payments
or liquidation proceeds received. The following table presents Farmer Mac's loan
purchases of newly  originated and current  seasoned  loans and defaulted  loans
purchased underlying Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs.

     The  weighted-average  age of the Farmer Mac I newly originated and current

total of Farmer Mac I newly  originated  and current  seasoned  loans  purchased

maturity   date,   resulting   in  balloon   payments   at   maturity,   with  a
weighted-average remaining term to maturity of 14.7 years. Of the combined total
of Farmer Mac I newly originated and current seasoned loans purchased during the
nine months ended September 30, 2002, 76 percent had amortization periods longer
than the  maturity  date,  resulting  in balloon  payments at  maturity,  with a
weighted-average remaining term to maturity of 10.7 years.

     The  weighted-average  age of the Farmer Mac I newly originated and current

September  30, 2001 was one month and one month,  respectively.  Of the combined
total of Farmer Mac I newly  originated  and current  seasoned  loans  purchased
during third quarter 2001, 70 percent had  amortization  periods longer than the

weighted-average  remaining term to maturity of 14 years.  Of the combined total
of Farmer Mac I newly originated and current seasoned loans purchased during the
nine months ended September 30, 2001, 74 percent had amortization periods longer
than the  maturity  date,  resulting  in balloon  payments at  maturity,  with a
weighted-average remaining term to maturity of 13.9 years.

     The  weighted-average  age of delinquent loans purchased out of securitized
pools and LTSPCs during third  quarter 2002 and the nine months ended  September
30,  2002 was 3.6 years and 4.0 years,  respectively,  compared to 4.4 years and
4.6 years, respectively, during the third quarter 2001 and the nine months ended
September 30, 2001.

     See  "Overview"  above  for a  discussion  regarding  Farmer  Mac I program
activities,  including  loans  purchased and held as loans and those  underlying
Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities or an LTSPC;  and USDA  guaranteed  portions
purchased and retained under the Farmer Mac II program.

     Indicators of future loan purchase and guarantee  volume (but not of future
LTSPC,  swap  or cash  window  portfolio  purchase  volume)  in the  immediately
succeeding  reporting period include  outstanding  commitments to purchase loans
(other  than  under an  LTSPC)  and the total  balance  of loans  submitted  for
approval or approved but not yet purchased.  Many purchase  commitments  entered
into by Farmer Mac are mandatory  delivery  commitments.  If a Seller  obtains a
mandatory  commitment and is unable to deliver the loans as required thereunder,
Farmer Mac  requires  the  Seller to pay a fee to  modify,  extend or cancel the
commitment. As of September 30, 2002, outstanding commitments to purchase Farmer
Mac I loans totaled $12.0 million, compared to $19.0 million as of September 30,
2001. Of the total Farmer Mac I commitments outstanding as of September 30, 2002
and  2001,  $9.7  million  and  $15.8  million,  respectively,   were  mandatory
commitments.  Loans  submitted for approval or approved but not yet committed to
purchase  totaled  $69.0  million as of September  30, 2002,  compared to $137.1
million as of September 30, 2001. Not all of these loans are purchased,  as some
are denied for credit reasons or withdrawn by the Seller.

     While significant progress has been made in developing the secondary market
for  agricultural  mortgages,  Farmer Mac  continues to face the  challenges  of
establishing a market where none previously existed.  Acceptance of Farmer Mac's
programs is increasing among lenders,  reflecting the competitive  rates,  terms
and  products  offered  and the  advantages  Farmer Mac  believes  its  programs
provide.  As of September 30, 2002, Farmer Mac's outstanding  program volume was
$5.2 billion, which represented  approximately 11% of management's estimate of a
$46 billion market of eligible  agricultural  mortgage loans.  For Farmer Mac to
succeed in realizing its business development and profitability  objectives over
the longer term, the use of Farmer Mac's  programs and products by  agricultural
mortgage  lenders,  whether  traditional  or  non-traditional,  must continue to
expand.  The drop in new  business  volume  during the third  quarter 2002 was a
result of the normal  seasonal  slowdown  in new  agricultural  mortgage  loans,
anticipated  in the third  quarter of each  year,  compounded  by the  dampening
effect of inaccurate and misleading media coverage on business during the spring
and summer months.  For the fourth quarter,  Farmer Mac's new business prospects
appear to have  looked  past that  media  coverage  and  management  is seeing a
resumption of normal interest in its business.

     As of  September  30,  2002,  there were 213  approved  loan Sellers in the
Farmer Mac I program (an increase of 5 Sellers over the prior quarter),  ranging
from single-office to multi-branch institutions,  spanning community banks, Farm
Credit System  associations,  mortgage companies,  large multi-state Farm Credit
System banks,  commercial  banks and insurance  companies.  To be considered for
approval as a Farmer Mac I Seller,  a financial  institution  must meet criteria
established by Farmer Mac, including:

     o    own a requisite  amount of Farmer Mac Class A or Class B voting common
          stock  according  to a  schedule  prescribed  for the size and type of
          institution;

     o    have  the  ability  and  experience  to  make  or  purchase  and  sell
          agricultural mortgage loans of the type that will qualify for purchase
          by Farmer Mac and service such mortgage  loans in accordance  with the
          Farmer  Mac  requirements  either  through  its own  staff or  through
          contractors and originators;

     o    maintain a minimum adjusted net worth of $1.0 million;

     o    maintain a fidelity bond and errors and omissions  insurance  coverage
          (or acceptable  substitute  insurance coverage) in a prescribed amount
          according to the size of the institution; and

     o    enter into a Seller/Servicer agreement to comply with the terms of the
          Farmer  Mac  Seller/Servicer  Guide,  including   representations  and
          warranties regarding the origination of eligible loans.

     Any lender  authorized by the USDA to obtain a USDA guarantee on a loan may
be a Seller in the Farmer Mac II program.  As of September 30, 2002,  there were
141 active  Sellers in the Farmer Mac II program (an increase of 10 Sellers over
the prior quarter), consisting mostly of community and regional banks.

Balance Sheet Review

     During the nine months ended September 30, 2002,  total assets increased by
$615.8  million,  with  increases  in  program  assets  (Farmer  Mac  Guaranteed
Securities  and  loans) of  $622.9  million  (exclusive  of real  estate  owned)
attributable to a $489.3 million  portfolio of loans purchased in April 2002 and
other  Farmer  Mac I and  Farmer  Mac  II  purchases.  For  further  information
regarding  on- and  off-balance  sheet  program  activities,  see  "Supplemental
Information"  below.  Consistent  with the increase in total  assets  during the
period, total liabilities  increased by $554.7 million from December 31, 2001 to
September 30, 2002.

     During  the  nine  months  ended  September  30,  2002,  accumulated  other
comprehensive income increased $6.0 million,  which is the net effect of a $36.3
million  increase in  unrealized  gains on  securities  available for sale and a
$30.3 million decrease in the fair value of financial derivatives  classified as
cash flow hedges.  Accumulated other comprehensive  income is not a component of
Farmer Mac's core capital or regulatory capital.

     Average  return on common  equity was 12.9 percent for third  quarter 2002,
compared to 16.4  percent for third  quarter  2001.  The effects of SFAS 133 and
SFAS 115 reduced the  average  return on common  equity by 3.4 percent for third
quarter 2002 and by 1.3 percent for third quarter 2001.

     As of September 30, 2002, Farmer Mac's core capital totaled $181.1 million,
compared to $126.0  million as of December 31, 2001.  As of September  30, 2002,
the actual core capital balance exceeded Farmer Mac's statutory  minimum capital
requirement of $129.7 million by $51.4 million.

     The FCA issued its final  risk-based  capital  regulation for Farmer Mac on
April 12, 2001 and the Corporation  was required to meet the risk-based  capital
standards  beginning  on May  23,  2002.  The  risk-based  capital  stress  test
promulgated  by the FCA ("RBC  test") is  intended  to  determine  the amount of
regulatory  capital  (core capital plus  allowance for losses)  Farmer Mac would
need to maintain positive capital during a ten-year period in which:

     o    annual  losses  occur at a rate of default  and  severity  "reasonably
          related" to the rates of the highest sequential two-years in a limited
          U.S. geographic area; and

     o    there is an  initial  interest  rate  shock at the lesser of 600 basis
          points or 50 percent of the ten-year U.S. Treasury rate, and remain at
          such level for the remainder of the period.

The RBC test  then  adds an  additional  30  percent  to the  resulting  capital
requirement for management and operational risk.

     Farmer Mac was in compliance  with the risk-based  capital  standards under
the  regulation as of September 30, 2002 and is confident  that it will continue
to be in  compliance.  As of  September  30,  2002,  the RBC  test  generated  a
regulatory capital requirement of $59.4 million. Farmer Mac's regulatory capital
of $200.2 million  exceeded that amount by  approximately  $140.8  million.  The
decrease  in the  risk-based  capital  requirement  from  June 30,  2002  ($80.1
million)  to  September  30,  2002  ($59.4  million)  was a result of changes in
interest rates and the seasoning of Farmer Mac's  portfolio.  The Corporation is
required  to  hold  capital  at the  higher  of the  statutory  minimum  capital
requirement or the amount required by the RBC test.

Risk Management

     Interest  Rate Risk.  Farmer Mac is  subject to  interest  rate risk on all
assets held for investment  because of possible  timing  differences in the cash
flows of the assets and related  liabilities.  This risk is primarily related to
loans held and  Farmer  Mac  Guaranteed  Securities  because  of the  ability of
borrowers to prepay their  mortgages  before the scheduled  maturities,  thereby
increasing  the risk of asset  and  liability  cash flow  mismatches.  Cash flow
mismatches  in a changing rate  environment  can reduce the value of earnings of
the  Corporation  if assets repay sooner than  expected and the  resulting  cash
flows must be reinvested in lower-yielding investments when Farmer Mac's funding
costs  cannot be  correspondingly  reduced,  or if assets repay more slowly than
expected and the associated debt must be replaced by higher-cost debt.

     Yield maintenance  provisions and other prepayment  penalties  contained in
many agricultural mortgage loans reduce, but do not eliminate,  this risk. Those
provisions  require  borrowers  to make an  additional  payment when they prepay
their loans, and so also serve as a disincentive to prepayment.  When reinvested
with the prepaid principal,  yield maintenance  payments generate  substantially
the same cash flows that would have been generated had the loan not prepaid.  As
of September 30, 2002, 60 percent of the  outstanding  balance of all loans held
and loans  underlying  on-balance  sheet Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities (91
percent of those with fixed rates) was covered by yield  maintenance  provisions
and other  prepayment  penalties.  As of September  30, 2002,  52 percent of the
total  outstanding  balance  of  retained  Farmer  Mac I  loans  and  Guaranteed
Securities  had yield  maintenance  provisions and 8 percent had another form of
prepayment protection. Of the Farmer Mac I loans purchased in third quarter 2002
and the nine  months  ended  September  30,  2002,  5  percent  and 60  percent,
respectively,  had yield  maintenance or another form of prepayment  protection.
None of the guaranteed portions  underlying Farmer Mac II Guaranteed  Securities
had yield maintenance provisions.

     The goal of  interest-rate-risk  management  at  Farmer  Mac is to create a
portfolio that generates  stable earnings and value across a variety of interest
rate environments. Farmer Mac's primary strategy for managing interest rate risk
is to fund asset  purchases  with  liabilities  that have similar  durations and
therefore interest rate sensitivities.  To achieve this match, Farmer Mac issues
discount  notes and both callable and  non-callable  medium-term  notes across a
spectrum of maturities and purchases financial derivatives to alter the duration
and  interest  rate  sensitivities  of its  liabilities.  By  using a  blend  of
liabilities that includes callable debt, the interest rate  sensitivities of the
liabilities  tend to increase or decrease as interest  rates  change in a manner
similar to changes in the interest rate sensitivities of the assets.

     Farmer Mac's cash and cash  equivalents  mature within three months and are
match-funded   with  discount  notes  having  similar   maturities.   Investment
securities  consist  predominately  of floating  rate  securities  that re-price
within one year.  These floating rate  investments  are funded using a series of
Discount Note issuances.  Each successive  Discount Note issuance matures on the
corresponding re-pricing date of the related investment.

     Farmer Mac is also subject to interest rate risk on loans,  including loans
that Farmer Mac has committed to acquire but has not yet purchased.  When Farmer
Mac commits to purchase a loan,  it is exposed to interest rate risk between the
time it commits to purchase  the loan and the time it either:  (a) sells  Farmer
Mac I Guaranteed Securities backed by the loan, or (b) issues debt to retain the
loan in its portfolio  (although  issuing debt to fund the loan as an investment
does  not  fully  mitigate  interest  rate  risk  due  to  the  possible  timing
differences  in the  cash  flows  of the  assets  and  related  liabilities,  as
discussed  above).  Farmer Mac manages the  interest  rate risk  related to such
loans, and the Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities to be issued and guaranteed or
debt to be issued to fund the loans as retained investments,  through the use of
forward  sale  contracts  on the debt and  mortgage-backed  securities  of other
government-sponsored  enterprises and futures contracts  involving U.S. Treasury
securities.  Farmer  Mac  uses  government-sponsored   enterprise  forward  sale
contracts  to reduce  Farmer  Mac's  interest  rate  exposure to changes in both
Treasury rates and spreads on Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities.

     Farmer Mac regularly  assesses its interest rate sensitivity and rebalances
its portfolio of assets and liabilities as necessary  through:

     o    the purchase of mortgage assets in the ordinary course of business;

     o    the refunding of existing liabilities; or

     o    the use of derivatives to alter the characteristics of existing assets
          or liabilities.

     The most  comprehensive  measure of Farmer Mac's  interest rate risk is the
sensitivity  of its Market  Value of Equity  ("MVE")  to  parallel  yield  curve
shocks.  MVE  represents the present value of all future cash flows from on- and
off-balance sheet assets,  liabilities and financial  derivatives  discounted at
current interest rates. The following schedule  summarizes the results of Farmer
Mac's MVE sensitivity analysis as of September 30, 2002 and December 31, 2001 to
an immediate and instantaneous parallel shift in the yield curve.

 <TABLE>

       - 300 bp             N/A*             -16.2%
*   As  of  September  30, 2002, a -200  bp  parallel
    shift of the U.S. Treasury  yield  curve produced
    negative interest rates for maturities of 2 years
    and shorter.
</TABLE>


     Net Interest Income ("NII") sensitivity, a shorter-term measure of interest
rate risk,  demonstrates a similar lack of exposure to interest rate  movements.
As of September 30, 2002, a uniform or  "parallel"  increase of 100 basis points
would increase NII by 5.5 percent, while a parallel decrease of 100 basis points
would decrease NII by 3.9 percent.  Farmer Mac also measures the  sensitivity of
both MVE and NII to a variety of  non-parallel  interest rate shocks,  including
flattening and steepening yield curve scenarios. Both MVE and NII continue to be
less  sensitive to  non-parallel  shocks than to the parallel  shocks.  Finally,
Farmer Mac's duration gap,  another measure of interest rate risk, was minus 4.4
months as of September 30, 2002. The  sensitivity of Farmer Mac's MVE and NII to
both  parallel and  non-parallel  interest  rate shocks,  and the duration  gap,
demonstrate  the  effectiveness  of the  Corporation's  approach to managing its
interest rate risk exposures.

     During the first  three  quarters  of 2002,  interest  rates have fallen to
historic lows and interest rate  volatilities have increased  dramatically.  For
example, the five-year Treasury yield declined from 4.3% on December 31, 2001 to
2.6% on September 30, 2002. It is expected that Farmer Mac's  interest-rate-risk
profile would also shift in such an interest rate environment. As interest rates
have declined dramatically and expected prepayments  increased,  the duration of
Farmer  Mac's  assets  that do not  have  prepayment  protection  has  shortened
somewhat faster than that of its liabilities.  Therefore, this rapid decrease in
interest  rates  has  widened  the  duration  gap of  Farmer  Mac's  assets  and
liabilities  somewhat  and has given both MVE and NII  positive  sensitivity  to
increasing  interest rates and negative  sensitivity  to continued  decreases in
interest rates.  While Farmer Mac's interest rate  sensitivity  increased during
the third quarter,  it remained  relatively stable and at relatively low levels,
despite the volatile interest rate environment.

     The economic  effects of financial  derivatives,  including  interest  rate
swaps,  are  included in the MVE,  NII and  duration  gap  analyses.  Farmer Mac
generally  enters into interest rate swap contracts in which it pays fixed rates
of interest to, and receives  floating rates of interest  from,  counterparties;
and also enters into  interest  rate swap  contracts in which it receives  fixed
rates of interest from, and pays floating rates of interest to,  counterparties.
These swaps are used to reduce interest rate risk as follows:

     o    "floating-to-fixed  interest rate swaps" adjust the characteristics of
          short-term  debt to match  more  closely  the cash  flow and  duration
          characteristics of longer-term reset and fixed-rate mortgage and other
          assets; and

     o    "fixed-to-floating  interest rate swaps" adjust the characteristics of
          its long-term debt to match more closely the cash flow and duration of
          its short-term assets.


These swaps also provide an overall lower effective cost of borrowing than would
otherwise be  available in the  conventional  debt market.  As of September  30,
2002,  Farmer Mac had $741.5 million  combined  notional amount of interest rate
swaps,  of which $656.5 million were  floating-to-fixed  interest rate swaps and
$85.0 million were  fixed-to-floating  interest  rate swaps,  with terms ranging
from 2 to 15 years.

     Farmer Mac uses derivative instruments as an end-user for hedging purposes,
not for trading or speculative  purposes.  When financial  derivatives  meet the
specific  hedge  criteria  under SFAS 133, they are accounted for as either fair
value  hedges or cash flow  hedges.  Financial  derivatives  that do not satisfy
those hedge  criteria  are not  accounted  for as hedges and changes in the fair
value of those financial  derivatives are reported in income or expense.  All of
Farmer   Mac's   derivatives   transactions   are   conducted   under   standard
collateralized  agreements that limit Farmer Mac's potential  credit exposure to
any counterparty.  As of September 30, 2002, Farmer Mac had no  uncollateralized
net exposure to any counterparty.

     Credit Risk.  Farmer Mac I credit  underwriting  standards require that the
loan-to-value  ratio for any loan (other than a part-time farm loan or a loan on
an  agricultural  facility  with a related  integrator  contract)  not exceed 70
percent.  In the case of newly  originated  loans  that are not  part-time  farm
loans, the underwriting  standards require,  among other things,  that borrowers
also meet the following  standard credit ratios:  (1) a pro forma (after closing
the new loan)  debt-to-asset  ratio of 50 percent or less;  (2) a pro forma cash
flow debt service coverage ratio on the mortgaged property of not less than 1:1;
(3) a pro forma total debt service  coverage ratio,  including farm and non-farm
income, of not less than 1.25:1;  and (4) a pro forma ratio of current assets to
current liabilities of not less than 1:1.

     Farmer Mac's underwriting  standards provide for, on a loan-by-loan  basis,
acceptance  of  loans  that  do  not  conform  to one or  more  of the  standard
underwriting  ratios -- other than loan-to-value -- when: (1) those loans exceed
one or more of the  underwriting  standards  to a degree  that  compensates  for
noncompliance with one or more other standards ("compensating  strengths");  and
(2) those loans are made to producers of particular agricultural  commodities in
a segment of agriculture in which such compensating strengths are typical of the
financial  condition  of  sound  borrowers.  Farmer  Mac's  use of  compensating
strengths  is not  intended  to  provide a basis for  waiving or  lessening  the
requirement  that loans be of  consistently  high  quality.  As of September 30,
2002, a total of $1.4 billion (31 percent) of the  outstanding  balance of loans
held and loans underlying  Post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities and
LTSPCs were approved based upon  compensating  strengths ($40.1 million of which
had original  loan to value  ratios of greater  than 70  percent).  During third
quarter 2002,  $48.7 million (25 percent) of the loans  purchased or added under
LTSPCs were approved based upon  compensating  strengths ($515 thousand of which
had original loan to value ratios of greater than 70 percent). Loans approved on
the basis of  compensating  strengths  show a lower rate of default than that of
loans that conformed to all of the standard credit ratios.

     In the case of a seasoned loan (a loan that has been  outstanding  for five
or more years),  Farmer Mac  considers  sustained  performance  to be a reliable
alternative  indicator of a borrower's  ability to pay the loan according to its
terms.  A seasoned loan generally will be deemed an eligible loan if it has been
outstanding for at least five years and has a  loan-to-value  ratio (based on an
updated  estimate  of  value) of 60  percent  or less,  and  there  have been no
payments  more than 30 days past due  during  the  previous  three  years and no
material  restructurings or modifications for credit reasons during the previous
five  years.  Loans  that have been  outstanding  for fewer than five years must
comply with the underwriting  standards for newly originated loans when the loan
was  originated.  The due  diligence  Farmer  Mac  performs  prior to  purchase,
guarantee or commitment of such loans depends upon the size,  age and collateral
for the loans:

     o    Loans  originated more than five years before the purchase,  guarantee
          or commitment  are reviewed  based on the payment  record on the loan,
          the  commodity  produced on the  underlying  property and the original
          appraised value.

     o    Loans  originated  within one year are subject to the same  collateral
          underwriting criteria as newly-originated  loans purchased through the
          cash window.

Because  Farmer Mac  effectively  assumes  the credit risk on all loans under an
LTSPC, Farmer Mac's commodity and geographic diversification disclosures reflect
all loans under LTSPCs and any such loans that have been  purchased out of LTSPC
pools.

     Farmer Mac  maintains an allowance  for losses  (previously  referred to as
reserve  for  losses)  to cover  estimated  probable  losses  on loans  held for
investment,  real estate owned and loans  underlying  Post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I
Guaranteed  Securities and LTSPCs in accordance  with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for
Contingencies,  ("SFAS  5") and  SFAS  No.  114,  Accounting  by  Creditors  for
Impairment of a Loan ("SFAS 114"). The methodology for determining the allowance
for  losses  is the same for loans  held for  investment  and  loans  underlying
Post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities  and LTSPCs because Farmer Mac
believes  the  ultimate  credit  risk is the  same,  i.e.,  the  credit  risk of
underlying   agricultural   mortgage   loans  that  all  meet  the  same  credit
underwriting  and  appraisal  standards.  For accepting the credit risk on loans
underlying Post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities and LTSPCs,  Farmer
Mac receives guarantee fees and commitment fees,  respectively.  For loans held,
Farmer Mac receives interest income that includes a component that correlates to
its guarantee fee, which Farmer Mac views as compensation  for accepting  credit
risk.

     No  allowance  for losses has been made for loans  underlying  Farmer Mac I
Guaranteed  Securities  issued prior to the 1996 Act or Farmer Mac II Guaranteed
Securities.  Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities issued prior to the 1996 Act are
supported by unguaranteed first loss subordinated interests,  which are expected
to exceed  the  estimated  credit  losses on those  loans.  Guaranteed  Portions
collateralizing  Farmer Mac II Guaranteed  Securities are guaranteed by the USDA
and are  obligations  backed by the full faith and credit of the United  States.
Farmer Mac has experienced no losses on any pre-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed
Securities or on any Farmer Mac II Guaranteed  Securities and does not expect to
incur any such losses in the future.

     The  allowance  for  losses  is  presented  in  three   components  on  the
consolidated  balance  sheet: o an "Allowance for loan losses" on loans held for
investment;  o a valuation  allowance on real estate owned, which is included in
the balance sheet under "Real estate owned, net of valuation  allowance";  and o
an  allowance  for  losses  on  loans  underlying  Post-1996  Act  Farmer  Mac I
Guaranteed  Securities and LTSPCs,  which is included in the balance sheet under
"Reserve for losses."

During the quarter ended  September 30, 2002,  Farmer Mac  reclassified  certain
components of its allowance for losses to further clarify its presentation.  See
Note  1(c)  and  (g) to the  condensed  consolidated  financial  statements  for
additional information.

     Farmer  Mac's  allowance  for losses  consists of both general and specific
reserves.  Farmer Mac's general reserves represent management's best estimate of
probable  losses  inherent  in  Farmer  Mac's  portfolio  of  performing  loans,
including  loans held for investment and loans  underlying  Post-1996 Act Farmer
Mac I Guaranteed  Securities and LTSPCs, at the balance sheet date in accordance
with SFAS 5. In  estimating  probable  losses to determine  the level of general
reserves, management considers factors, such as economic conditions,  geographic
and agricultural commodity concentrations,  the credit profile of the portfolio,
delinquency  trends  and  historical  charge-off  and  recovery  activity,   and
evaluates  the results of its  proprietary  Loan Pool  Simulation  and Guarantee
Model.  That econometric  risk-simulation  model runs various  configurations of
loan types, terms,  economic  conditions,  and borrower  eligibility criteria to
generate a  distribution  of possible loss  exposures over time for Farmer Mac's
portfolio.  The model uses  historical  agricultural  real estate  industry loan
origination and servicing data that reflect varied general  economic  conditions
and stress levels in the agricultural  sector.  The model contains features that
allow variation for changes in loan portfolio characteristics specific to Farmer
Mac's  portfolio  and credit  underwriting  standards.  The model  considers the
effects of the  ageing of the loan  portfolio  along the  expected  loss  curves
associated with individual cohort origination years, including the segments that
are entering into or coming out of their peak default years. Farmer Mac analyzes
various  runs of the model to evaluate its  allowance  for losses and back tests
results to  validate  the model by using  prior  period  data to project  losses
expected in a current period,  and comparing those  projections to actual losses
incurred during the current period.

     Farmer Mac's specific reserves represent  management's best estimate of the
impairment  inherent in its portfolio of non-performing  loans as of the balance
sheet date in accordance  with SFAS 114. The portfolio of  non-performing  loans
consists  of all loans  held and loans  underlying  Post-1996  Act  Farmer Mac I
Guaranteed  Securities  and  LTSPCs  that  were 90 days or  more  past  due,  in
foreclosure,  restructured,  in bankruptcy  (including  loans  performing  under
either their original loan terms or a  court-approved  bankruptcy plan) and real
estate  owned.  Farmer Mac  measures  impairment  based on the fair value of the
underlying  collateral for each non-performing loan. Farmer Mac conducts regular
loan-by-loan  analyses  of its  non-performing  loans to assess the value of the
collateral  supporting  each  individual  loan relative to the total amount due,
including  principal,  interest  and  advances.  In the event  that the  updated
appraisal  or  management's  estimate of  discounted  collateral  value does not
support the total amount due, Farmer Mac specifically  allocates reserves to the
loan for the difference between the recorded investment and its fair value, less
management's estimate of the costs to liquidate the collateral.

     The  allowance  for losses is increased  through  periodic  provisions  for
losses charged to expense and reduced by charge-offs for actual loan losses, net
of  recoveries  that are  recognized if  liquidation  proceeds  exceed  previous
estimates.  Charge-offs  represent losses on the outstanding  principal balance,
any interest  payments  previously  accrued or advanced  and  expected  costs of
liquidation.  Additionally,  specific  reserves  for losses on loans  underlying
Post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities or LTSPCs are  reclassified to
the allowance for loan losses when loans for which  specific  reserves have been
allocated are reported as loans on the balance  sheet after  purchase (a) out of
Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities or (b) in fulfillment of the commitment under
an LTSPC. The following schedules summarize the changes in the components of the
allowance for losses for the three-month and nine-month  periods ended September
30, 2002 and 2001:

     Farmer Mac's  provision for losses was $2.0 million for third quarter 2002,
compared to $2.0 million for third  quarter  2001.  During third  quarter  2002,
Farmer Mac charged off $1.5 million in losses  against the  allowance for losses
and  recovered  $0.3  million  from  previously  charged  off  losses,  for  net
charge-offs of $1.2 million. Net charge-offs for the nine months ended September
30,  2002  were  $2.8  million.  The  net  charge-offs  for  third  quarter  and
year-to-date  2002 included $0.4 million and $0.6 million  related to previously
accrued or advanced interest on Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities,  compared to
$0.2 million and $0.4 million for the same periods in 2001.

     As of September 30, 2002,  Farmer Mac's  allowance for losses totaled $19.1
million,  or 42 basis points of the  outstanding  loans held held for investment
and loans  underlying  Post-1996  Act Farmer  Mac I  Guaranteed  Securities  and
LTSPCs,  compared to $15.9 million (46 basis points) as of December 31, 2001 and
$14.7 million (44 basis points) as of September 30, 2001.

      As of September 30, 2002, loans held and loans underlying Post-1996 Act
Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs that were 90 days or more past
due, in foreclosure, restructured, in bankruptcy (including loans performing
under either their original loan terms or a court-approved bankruptcy plan) and
real estate owned ("Post-1996 Act delinquencies") totaled $91.3 million and
represented 2.03 percent of the principal balance of all loans held and loans
underlying Post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs, compared
to $65.2 million (1.45 percent) as of June 30, 2002, $58.3 million (1.70
percent) as of December 31, 2001, and $71.3 million (2.16 percent) as of
September 30, 2001. Loans that have been restructured were insignificant and are
included within the reported delinquency disclosures. From quarter to quarter,
Farmer Mac anticipates fluctuations in the delinquencies, both in dollars and as
a percentage of the outstanding portfolio, with higher levels likely at the end
of the first and third quarters of each year due to the semi-annual payment
characteristics of most Farmer Mac I loans.

</TABLE>


     As expected, the increasing proportions of Farmer Mac's portfolio of loans,
guarantees and  commitments  entering their peak  delinquency  and default years
(years three  through five after  origination)  caused the dollars of delinquent
loans and  period-over-period  charge-offs  to  increase  year-over-year.  As of
September  30,  2002,  approximately  $1.8  billion (39 percent) of Farmer Mac's
outstanding  loans  held  and  loans  underlying  Post-1996  Act  Farmer  Mac  I
Guaranteed  Securities  and LTSPCs  were in their peak  delinquency  and default
years  compared to $1.1 billion (32  percent) of such loans as of September  30,
2001. Farmer Mac's Loan Pool Simulation and Guarantee Model takes that portfolio
distribution and maturation into  consideration.  Accordingly,  those trends did
not cause management to alter the model's projection for the quarterly provision
for losses compared to prior quarters.

     Farmer Mac  charges  off  losses  against  the  allowance  for losses  when
management believes a loss has occurred, but no later than the time at which the
Corporation  takes possession of the property.  As of September 30, 2002, Farmer
Mac's  loan-by-loan  analysis of its $91.3 million of delinquent loans and their
updated appraisals or management's estimates of discounted values indicated that
$12.1 million had  insufficient  collateral  to cover the loan balance,  accrued
interest and expenses.  Farmer Mac has  specifically  allocated  $2.2 million of
allowances  to  those  under-collateralized  loans.  Farmer  Mac's  loan-by-loan
analyses  indicated  that the remaining  $79.2 million of delinquent  loans were
adequately collateralized, based on updated appraisals or management's estimates
of discounted  collateral values, and that the allocation of specific allowances
to those loans was not necessary. As of September 30, 2002, after the allocation
of specific allowances to under-collateralized  loans, Farmer Mac had additional
non-specific  or  general  allowances  of  $16.9  million,  bringing  the  total
allowance  for losses to $19.1  million.  The  following  table  summarizes  the
Corporation's delinquencies and allowance for losses:

</TABLE>

     Based on Farmer Mac's loan-by-loan analyses, loan collection experience and
continuing  provisions  for the allowance  for losses,  Farmer Mac believes that
ongoing losses will be covered adequately by the allowance for losses.

     As of September 30, 2002, the weighted-average original loan-to-value ratio
for all Post-1996 Act loans was 49 percent,  and the  weighted-average  original
loan-to-value  ratio for all  Post-1996  Act  delinquent  loans was 56  percent.
Original  loan-to-value  ratios are one of many factors  Farmer Mac considers in
evaluating loss severity.  Other factors include,  but are not limited to, other
underwriting  standards,  commodity and farming  forecasts and regional economic
and  agricultural  conditions.  The following table summarizes the Post-1996 Act
delinquencies by original  loan-to-value  ratio (calculated by dividing the loan
principal  balance  at the time of  guarantee,  purchase  or  commitment  by the
appraised  value at the date of loan  origination  or, when  available,  updated
appraised value at the time of guarantee, purchase or commitment):

     An  analysis  of  Farmer  Mac's  actual  losses  and  identified   specific
collateral  deficiencies  within the portfolio (by  origination  year) indicates
that Farmer Mac has experienced peak loss years as loans have aged between their
third and fifth years  subsequent  to  origination,  regardless  of the year the
loans  were  added  to the  Farmer  Mac's  portfolio.  As a  consequence  of the
combination of principal  amortization and collateral value appreciation,  there
are few loans in the portfolio  originated  prior to 1997 with known  collateral
deficiencies.  While  Farmer Mac  expects  that loans which have aged past their
fifth year may  become  delinquent  and  possibly  default,  Farmer Mac does not
anticipate  significant losses as a consequence of collateral  shortfalls on any
such loans.

     Analysis of the portfolio by its  geographic  distribution  indicates  that
losses and  collateral  deficiencies  have been and remain most prevalent in the
loans  concentrated in the Northwest.  This is consistent with the corresponding
commodity  analysis which indicates that Farmer Mac has experienced  higher loss
and collateral  deficiency rates in its loans classified as permanent  plantings
(many of which are located in the  Northwest).  Most of the loans  classified as
permanent  plantings  do not  receive  significant  government  support  and are
therefore  more  susceptible  to  adverse  commodity-specific  economic  trends.
Further, as adverse economic conditions persist for a particular  commodity that
is a  long-term  improvement  on the  land,  such as  permanent  plantings,  the
prospective  sale value of the land is likely to decrease and the related  loans
may  become  under-collateralized.  Farmer  Mac  anticipates  that  one or  more
particular  commodity groups will be under economic pressure at any one time and
actively manages its portfolio to mitigate  concentration risks while preserving
the ability to meet the financing needs of all commodity groups.

     Farmer Mac's  methodologies  for pricing its guarantee fee, managing credit
risks and providing adequate allowances for losses consider all of the foregoing
factors and information.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

     Farmer Mac has  sufficient  liquidity and capital  resources to support its
operations for the next twelve months.

     Debt  Issuances.  Farmer  Mac funds its  program  operations  primarily  by
issuing debt  obligations of various  maturities in the public capital  markets.
Farmer Mac's debt  obligations  consist of discount notes and medium-term  notes
issued to obtain funds  principally to cover the costs of purchasing and holding
loans and securities  (including Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities).  Farmer Mac
also  issues  discount  notes  and   medium-term   notes  to  obtain  funds  for
investments,   transaction  costs  and  guarantee  payments.  The  Corporation's
discount notes and medium-term notes are obligations of Farmer Mac only, are not
rated by any rating  agency  and the  interest  and  principal  thereon  are not
guaranteed  by and do not  constitute  debts or  obligations  of the Farm Credit
Administration  or the  United  States or any agency or  instrumentality  of the
United States other than Farmer Mac.  Farmer Mac is an  institution  of the Farm
Credit  System,  but is not  liable  for any  debt or  obligation  of any  other
institution of the Farm Credit System. Likewise,  neither the Farm Credit System
nor any other individual institution of the Farm Credit System is liable for any
debt or  obligation  of Farmer Mac.  Income on Farmer Mac's  discount  notes and
medium-term notes has no tax exemption under federal law from federal,  state or
local taxation.

     Effective June 6, 2002,  Farmer Mac's Board of Directors has authorized the
issuance of up to $5.0 billion of discount notes and medium-term notes (of which
$3.7 billion was  outstanding  as of September  30,  2002),  subject to periodic
review  of the  adequacy  of that  level  relative  to  Farmer  Mac's  borrowing
requirements. Farmer Mac invests the proceeds of such issuances in loans, Farmer
Mac Guaranteed  Securities and non-program  investment assets in accordance with
guidelines established by its Board of Directors.

     Liquidity.  The  funding  and  liquidity  needs of  Farmer  Mac's  business
programs are driven by the purchase and  retention of eligible  loans and Farmer
Mac  Guaranteed  Securities,  the  maturities of Farmer Mac's discount notes and
medium-term notes and payment of principal and interest on Farmer Mac Guaranteed
Securities.  Farmer  Mac's  primary  sources  of funds to meet  these  needs are
issuances of new discount notes and  medium-term  notes,  principal and interest
payments  and  ongoing  guarantee  and  commitment  fees  received on Farmer Mac
Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs and the Corporation's net operating cash flows.

     Farmer Mac  projects  its  expected  cash flows from loans and  securities,
other earnings and the sale of assets and matches those with its  obligations to
retire  debt and pay  other  liabilities  as they come due.  Farmer  Mac  issues
discount  notes  and  medium-term  notes to meet the needs  associated  with its
business operations,  including liquidity,  and also to increase its presence in
the capital markets in order to enhance the liquidity and pricing  efficiency of
its discount notes and  medium-term  notes and Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities
transactions  and so improve the mortgage rates  available to farmers,  ranchers
and rural  homeowners.  Though Farmer Mac's mortgage  purchases do not currently
necessitate daily debt issuance,  Farmer Mac continued its strategy of using its
non-program   investment  portfolio  (referred  to  as  Farmer  Mac's  liquidity
portfolio) to facilitate  increasing its ongoing presence in the capital markets
during third quarter 2002.  To meet  investor  demand for daily  presence in the
capital markets, Farmer Mac issues discount notes in maturities ranging from one
day to  approximately  90 days and invests the  proceeds  not needed for program
asset  purchases  in highly  rated  securities.  Investments  are  predominantly
short-term  money  market  securities  with  maturities  closely  matched to the
discount note maturities and  floating-rate  securities with reset terms of less
than one year and closely  matched to the  maturity of the discount  notes.  The
positive spread earned from these  investments  enhances the net interest income
Farmer  Mac earns,  thereby  improving  the net  yields at which  Farmer Mac can
purchase  mortgages from lenders who may pass that benefit to farmers,  ranchers
and  rural  homeowners  through  the  Farmer  Mac  programs.  Subject  to dollar
limitations, the current Board guidelines authorize Farmer Mac to invest in U.S.
Treasury,  agency and  instrumentality  obligations and other highly-rated money
market and  medium-term  securities,  including:

     o    asset-backed securities.

As of  September  30,  2002,  Farmer  Mac  was in  compliance  with  the  dollar
limitations   and  investment   authorizations   set  forth  in  its  investment
guidelines.

     As a result  of  Farmer  Mac's  regular  issuance  of  discount  notes  and
medium-term notes and its status as a federally chartered instrumentality of the
United  States,  Farmer  Mac has been  able to access  the  capital  markets  at
favorable  rates.  Throughout  the recent  period of inaccurate  and  misleading
publicity about the Corporation,  Farmer Mac has maintained regular daily access
to the  discount  note market at rates  comparable  to the  issuance and trading
levels of other  government-sponsored  enterprise  discount notes.  Farmer Mac's
continued  ability to access the discount  note market at such  favorable  rates
could be affected by continued  inaccurate and misleading publicity about Farmer
Mac or unusual  trading in its  securities.  Farmer Mac  believes  such  factors
caused spread levels in secondary market trading of its outstanding  medium-term
notes to widen during  second  quarter  2002.  Although  those  trading  spreads
appeared to improve and Farmer Mac returned to issuing  MTNs on a limited  basis
during third quarter 2002 and achieved favorable issuance spreads, the foregoing
factors could affect future  medium-term  note  issuance  spreads  adversely and
cause Farmer Mac to continue to emphasize floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps,
combined with discount note issuances,  as a source of fixed-rate funding. While
the swap market provides favorable fixed rates, swap transactions  expose Farmer
Mac to basis  risk.  If the  spreads on the Farmer  Mac  discount  notes were to
increase  relative  to LIBOR,  Farmer  Mac would be  exposed  to a  commensurate
reduction   on  its  net  interest   yield  on  the   notional   amount  of  its
floating-to-fixed  interest  rate  swaps and  other  LIBOR-based  floating  rate
assets.  Farmer Mac  compensates for this risk by pricing the required net yield
on program  asset  purchases  to reflect  the higher cost of  medium-term  notes
issuance versus the savings achieved in the interest rate swap market.

     Farmer Mac maintains an investment  portfolio of cash and cash  equivalents
(including  commercial paper and other short-term money market  instruments) and
investment securities consisting mostly of floating rate securities that reprice
within one year,  which can be drawn upon for liquidity  needs.  As of September
30,  2002,  Farmer Mac's cash and cash  equivalents  and  investment  securities
totaled $493.2 million and $942.8 million,  respectively,  a combined 36 percent
of total assets.  For third quarter 2002,  exclusive of daily overnight discount
note issuances that were invested overnight,  the average discount note issuance
term and re-funding frequency was approximately 69 days.

Other Matters

     On June 26, 2002,  the Senate  Committee  on  Agriculture,  Nutrition,  and
Forestry  requested that the GAO conduct an independent  analysis of a number of
issues  relating to Farmer Mac.  The  Committee  made this request of the GAO in
response to recent misleading  reports and speculation about Farmer Mac produced
by certain stock traders,  known as "short  sellers," who are seeking to depress
the price of Farmer  Mac  securities  for their own gain,  and by  corresponding
articles  by a  reporter  for a major  newspaper.  Farmer Mac made it clear that
those reports were flawed and unfounded and welcomed this  independent  analysis
by the GAO as an opportunity  to confirm that Farmer Mac's mission  continues to
be met in a financially sound manner.

     Farmer Mac is confident  that the GAO's analysis will confirm its integrity
and  financial  stability,  as  presented in its public  financial  disclosures.
Farmer  Mac  expects  the GAO  report  will  show that it is  appropriately  and
effectively  fulfilling  its mission to increase  the  availability  of borrower
credit at stable  rates,  lender  liquidity and capital  markets  funding in the
agricultural sector of the U.S. economy for the benefit of farmers, ranchers and
rural homeowners, lenders participating in Farmer Mac programs and the investing
public.

     The GAO report  was  requested  by the  Committee  specifically  to address
Farmer Mac's financial stability;  corporate governance;  compensation policies;
investment  practices;  the  non-voting  status of Farmer  Mac's  Class C Common
Stock; and the fulfillment of Farmer Mac's Congressionally-established mission.

     Farmer Mac looks forward to the GAO report as an  opportunity to remove the
confusion that has been cast over it, so that it may continue its  Congressional
mission in a safe and sound manner.

                                                               Exhibit 10.7

                                  FARMER MAC I
                            SELLER/SERVICER AGREEMENT


     This Seller/Servicer Agreement (the "Agreement") is dated as of August 7th,
1996,  between  the  FEDERAL  AGRICULTURAL  MORTGAGE   CORPORATION,   a  federal
instrumentality  of the United States  ("Farmer  Mac") and Zions First  National
Bank, a National Association (the "Seller").  All capitalized terms used in this
Agreement  and not  otherwise  defined  shall have the meanings set forth in the
Selling and Servicing Guide (the "Guide").

     Farmer  Mac  operates  a  mortgage   loan   purchase   program  to  provide
agricultural mortgage lenders an agricultural  secondary mortgage market. Farmer
Mac is willing to purchase  Qualified  Loans from approved  sellers  pursuant to
mortgage purchase  programs  announced by Farmer Mac from time to time. As such,
Farmer Mac has  developed the Guide which sets forth the  requirements  for, and
conditions respecting,  participation in any mortgage purchase program announced
by Farmer Mac to purchase Qualified Loans.

     The Seller intends to originate or purchase  Qualified  Loans and sell such
loans to Farmer Mac.

     Farmer Mac, either itself or through a Farmer Mac designated Loan Reviewer,
will review  loan files with  respect to mortgage  loans  submitted  by approved
sellers for  purchase  and may approve such loans for sale to Farmer Mac if they
meet the  requirements  set forth in the Guide.  Farmer  Mac,  either  itself or
through a Farmer Mac designated  Central  Servicer,  will also service Qualified
Loans it purchases and will delegate  certain  servicing  responsibilities  with
respect to such Qualified Loans to the approved sellers under the conditions and
in accordance with the provisions of the Guide.

     The purpose of this  Agreement  is to  establish  the Seller as an approved
seller of Qualified  Loans to Farmer Mac; to provide the terms and conditions of
sales;  to  specify  the  requirements  with  respect  to loan file  review;  to
establish the Seller as a Field Servicer of Qualified  Loans on behalf of Farmer
Mac and any  Central  Servicer;  and to  provide  the  terms and  conditions  of
servicing.

     In consideration of the purpose of this Agreement and of all the provisions
and  mutual  promises  contained  herein,  the  Seller  and  Farmer Mac agree as
follows:

     Section 1. Seller/Servicer  Guide. Farmer Mac has provided the Guide to the
Seller and the Seller has received and reviewed the Guide which is  incorporated
herein by reference as though fully set forth in this Agreement.  Farmer Mac and
the Seller agree to comply with and be bound by all of the terms and  provisions
of the Guide which Farmer Mac may, in its  discretion and without the consent of
the Seller,  amend or  supplement  at any time by written  notice to the Seller.
From and  after the date of each  amendment  or  supplement,  the  Guide,  as so
amended or  supplemented,  shall be a part of this Agreement;  however,  no such
amendment  or  supplement  will affect any  Commitment  to Purchase  (rate lock)
issued  prior  to the  date of the  amendment  or  supplement  or any  servicing
obligations undertaken prior to such date.

     Section 2.  Selling.  Seller  eligibility  and sales of Qualified  Loans to
Farmer Mac hereunder shall be governed by Chapters 2 and 3 of the Guide.

     2.1 Individual  Commitments,  Separate Agreements.  Each purchase by Farmer
Mac  hereunder  will be made only  pursuant to a written  Commitment to Purchase
(rate lock).  Each  Commitment  to Purchase  (rate lock)  constitutes a separate
agreement  between the Seller and Farmer Mac with respect to each Qualified Loan
required  to be  delivered  or  actually  delivered  thereunder,  and each  such
separate  agreement may be separately  assigned,  and  separately  enforced,  by
Farmer Mac or any  assignee,  without  affecting  the rights of any party to, or
assignee  under,  such  Commitment  to Purchase  (rate lock) with respect to any
other mortgage loan.

     2.2 Basic Seller  Obligations.  There are certain basic obligations imposed
upon the Seller under this  Agreement,  including but not limited to obligations
to:

o    sell  Qualified  Loans to Farmer Mac once a  Commitment  to Purchase  (rate
     lock) has been issued by Farmer Mac;

o    pay a Pairoff fee to Farmer Mac in the event a Qualified Loan or substitute
     is not  delivered  in  accordance  with  the  terms of such  Commitment  to
     Purchase (rate lock), as set forth in 303.5 of the Guide; and

o    make representations and warranties with respect to each Qualified Loan and
     incur  certain   consequences   in  connection  with  the  breach  of  such
     representations and warranties, as set forth in 303 and 304 of the Guide.

     2.3 No Purchase Obligation.  The fact that Farmer Mac signed this Agreement
does not mean that Farmer Mac must issue a  Commitment  to Purchase  (rate lock)
any  mortgage  loan  submitted  to  Farmer  Mac for  review  and  approval.  Any
obligation  to  purchase  will  arise only after  review  and  approval  and the
issuance by Farmer Mac of a Commitment to Purchase (rate lock).

     Section  3. Loan File  Review.  Submission  of  documents  for  review  and
approval by Farmer Mac shall be governed by Chapter 3 of the Guide.

     Section 4.  Servicing.  Servicing of  Qualified  Loans  hereunder  shall be
governed by Chapter 4 of the Guide or by a field servicing  contract between the
Seller and a Central  Servicer,  if Farmer Mac assigns the central  servicing of
such Qualified Loans to a Central Servicer.  The field servicing  contract,  the
form of which will have been reviewed by Farmer Mac,  will neither  increase the
duties of nor reduce the field servicing fee to be paid to the Seller.

     Section 5. Events of Default; Remedies; Indemnification.  Seller will be in
default under this  Agreement  upon the occurrence of any Event of Default under
the  Guide,  and will be  subject  to any  remedies  available  to  Farmer  Mac,
including,  but not  limited  to,  indemnification  of Farmer  Mac and  Seller's
obligation to repurchase one or more of the Qualified  Loans,  as more fully set
forth in the Guide.

     Section 6.  Termination and Effect of  Termination.  This Agreement and the
Guide may be  terminated  as set forth in the  Guide.  The Guide  sets forth the
effect of any such termination.

      Section 7.  Miscellaneous.
                  -------------

     7.1 Notice.  Any notice  shall be given and shall be effective as specified
in 101.1 of the Guide and shall be given to Farmer Mac at the address  specified
in 101.1 of the Guide,  and to the Seller at the following  address,  or to such
other address as may be given by one party to the other party in writing:

  Seller's Address:     ZIONS FIRST NATIONAL BANK
                        Agriculture Group
                        190 North Main, P.O. Box 279
                        Spanish Fork, Utah 84660

     7.2  Severability  and  Enforcement.  If any  provision  of this  Agreement
conflicts with applicable  law, the other  provisions of this Agreement that can
be carried out without the conflicting provision will not be affected.

     All rights and remedies  under this  Agreement are distinct and  cumulative
not only as to each other but as to any rights or  remedies  afforded  by law or
equity. They may be exercised together, separately or successively.  Any failure
by Farmer Mac to exercise  any of its remedies  does not  constitute a waiver of
that remedy in the future as to the same or any other  Event of  Default.  These
rights and remedies are for the benefit of Farmer Mac and any of its  respective
successors and assigns.

     7.3  Governing  Law. This  Agreement  will be governed by, and construed in
accordance with,  federal law; to the extent federal law incorporates state law,
that state law shall be the laws of the District of Columbia.

     7.4  Assignability.  As more fully set forth in the Guide, it is understood
and agreed  that:  (i) Seller  may not  transfer  or assign any of its rights or
duties under this  Agreement  or the Guide  without  Farmer Mac's prior  written
consent;  and (ii)  Farmer Mac may  assign  its  rights  and  duties  under such
documents without Seller's consent or approval.

     7.5 Entire Agreement.  This Agreement and the Guide, including the exhibits
attached  to the  Guide and all  updates  and other  documents  incorporated  by
reference in the Guide,  constitute the entire understanding  between Farmer Mac
and the Seller and supersede all other agreements,  covenants,  representations,
warranties,  understandings and communications between the parties, whether oral
or written, with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Guide.

     This  Agreement may be executed in two or more  counterparts,  which,  when
combined, will constitute one instrument.

     This  Agreement  has been  executed  as of the date  first  written by duly
authorized representatives of Farmer Mac and the Seller.

                    FEDERAL AGRICULTURAL MORTGAGE CORPORATION

                                Medium-Term Notes

                          U.S. Selling Agency Agreement

Zions First National Bank
One South Main Street
Salt Lake City, Utah 84111

Ladies and Gentlemen:

     Federal  Agricultural  Mortgage  Corporation  ("Farmer  Mac"),  a federally
chartered  instrumentality of the United States established by Title VIII of the
Farm Credit Act of 1971, as amended (the "Charter  Act"),  proposes to issue and
sell from time to time its Medium-Term  Notes (any such  Medium-Term  Notes that
are issued and sold  pursuant to this  Agreement  are  referred to herein as the
"Notes") to or through Zions First National Bank ("Zions") and the other Agents,
if any, appointed pursuant to Section 1(c) hereof (collectively,  the "Agents").
The Notes will be issued under a fiscal  agency  agreement,  dated as of June 1,
1996,  as amended from time to time (the  "Fiscal  Agency  Agreement"),  between
Farmer Mac and the Federal  Reserve Banks,  as fiscal agent  (collectively,  the
"Fiscal Agent").

     The Notes will have  various  interest  rates or  interest  rate  formulas,
maturities, selling prices, and other terms. Farmer Mac will issue the Notes and
establish their terms from time to time in accordance with the Notes, the Master
Terms  Agreement,  dated as of July 1, 1996, among Farmer Mac and Holders of the
Notes and the Fiscal Agency Agreement.

     Farmer Mac has  prepared an offering  circular,  dated  August 14, 1998 (as
amended or supplemented from time to time, including the documents  incorporated
by reference therein, the "Offering Circular"), relating to the Notes. The Notes
are described  therein and may be further described in amendments or supplements
thereto.

     As of the date hereof,  Farmer Mac has  authorized the issuance and sale of
Notes to or through the Agents in an  aggregate  principal  amount  which,  when
added to its Discount Notes and previously  issued  Medium-Term  Notes, will not
exceed  $4,000,000,000  aggregate  principal  amount  (or,  based on the rate of
exchange on the applicable  trade date,  the  equivalent  thereof in one or more
foreign or composite currencies) at any one time outstanding.  It is understood,
however,  that  Farmer  Mac may from  time to time  authorize  the  issuance  of
additional  Notes and that such  additional  Notes may be sold to or through the
Agents  pursuant to the terms of this  Agreement,  all as though the issuance of
such Notes were authorized as of the date hereof.  Farmer Mac will not authorize
the Agents to sell any more Notes than Farmer Mac is authorized to sell.

     Farmer  Mac and  the  Agents  wish to  record  their  arrangements  for the
solicitation of offers to purchase and the sale of the Notes as follows:

      1. Appointment of Agents.

     (a) The Agents shall not have any  obligation to purchase Notes from Farmer
Mac as principal but may agree from time to time to purchase  Notes as principal
for resale to investors  and other  purchasers.  The purchase of Notes by one or
more Agents as principal  shall be in accordance  with terms agreed upon by such
Agent or Agents and Farmer Mac (which terms, unless otherwise agreed,  shall, to
the extent applicable,  include those terms specified in Exhibit A hereto and be
agreed upon orally (with written  confirmation  prepared by such Agent or Agents
and mailed to Farmer Mac) or in writing (each, a "Terms Agreement")). An Agent's
commitment  to purchase  Notes as  principal  pursuant to the  applicable  Terms
Agreement shall be deemed to have been made on the basis of the  representations
and warranties of Farmer Mac herein  contained and shall be subject to the terms
and  conditions  herein  set  forth.  Unless  the  context  otherwise  requires,
references  herein  to "this  Agreement"  shall  include  the  applicable  Terms
Agreement of one or more Agents to purchase Notes from Farmer Mac as principal.

     (b) If agreed upon by an Agent and Farmer Mac, such Agent, acting solely as
agent of Farmer Mac, will solicit purchases of Notes only in the  denominations,
in the form or forms, and at the purchase prices specified in, or established in
accordance with, this Agreement and the Offering Circular,  as from time to time
amended or supplemented.

     Each Agent  shall use its  reasonable  best  efforts,  consistent  with the
business  objectives  that Farmer Mac expressly  communicates to such Agent from
time to time,  to  solicit  offers  to  purchase  the  Notes  upon the terms and
conditions set forth herein and in the Offering  Circular,  as from time to time
amended or supplemented, and shall make such solicitation in compliance with the
applicable law of any jurisdiction.

     Each Agent shall  communicate  to Farmer Mac, by telephone to those persons
identified by Farmer Mac, any offer to purchase  Notes that such Agent  receives
and does not  reject.  Farmer Mac shall have the sole right to accept  offers to
purchase  the Notes and may reject  any such  offer,  in whole or in part.  Each
Agent may, in its discretion reasonably exercised,  reject any offer to purchase
Notes received by it, in whole or in part.

     Each Agent shall use its  reasonable  best efforts to assist  Farmer Mac in
obtaining  performance by each purchaser  whose offer to purchase Notes has been
solicited  by such  Agent and  accepted  by Farmer  Mac,  but shall not have any
liability  to  Farmer  Mac in the  event  such  purchase  for any  reason is not
consummated. Under no circumstances shall any Agent, in its capacity as agent of
Farmer Mac, be obligated to purchase any Notes for its own account.

     Farmer Mac, in its sole discretion,  may suspend  solicitation of offers to
purchase  the Notes  through  an Agent as agent at any time,  for any  period of
time, or permanently.  Upon receipt of notice from Farmer Mac, such Agent agrees
to promptly  suspend  solicitation  of offers to purchase  Notes from Farmer Mac
until  such  time  as  Farmer  Mac  has  advised   such  Agent  to  resume  such
solicitation.

     (c) Farmer Mac may,  in its sole  discretion,  at any time and from time to
time  appoint one or more  additional  agents to solicit or receive  offers from
others to purchase Notes. Any such additional agent shall, if directed by Farmer
Mac,  execute and  deliver to Farmer Mac an  instrument  (in form and  substance
acceptable to Farmer Mac) accepting such  appointment,  and thereupon such agent
shall  become a party to this  Agreement  and be subject to all the terms hereof
for the time or times and to the extent specified in such instrument. Farmer Mac
shall forthwith notify the existing Agents of any such appointment.

     Farmer Mac may also sell Notes  directly  to  investors,  other  investment
banking firms, investment dealers, or dealer banks on its own behalf. The Agents
also  acknowledge  that Farmer Mac may enter into a Placement  Agency  Agreement
relating to the offer and sale of Euro-Medium-Term Notes.

     (d) At the time of delivery  of, and payment  for, any Note that Farmer Mac
sells as a result of an offer to purchase  such Note that an Agent  communicated
to  Farmer  Mac,  Farmer  Mac  agrees  to pay the  Agent a  commission,  in full
compensation  for  its  services  pursuant  to  this  Agreement,  equal  to  the
percentage  of the principal  amount of such Note  specified in the Schedule set
forth in Exhibit B hereto (or as may be otherwise  agreed to in writing  between
the parties  hereto),  provided that in the case of the sale of a Note that is a
Note issued with  original  issue  discount,  Farmer Mac shall pay a  commission
equal to the  percentage  of the issue price of the Note,  as  specified  in the
Schedule set forth in Exhibit B hereto.

     Selling  commissions shall be paid by deduction by the appropriate Agent of
the  commission  payable to such Agent from the amount  payable to Farmer Mac in
settlement for the Notes.

     The purchase price (i.e.,  underwriting discount) of Notes purchased by one
or more Agents as principal  from Farmer Mac will be set forth in the applicable
Terms Agreement.

     (e) Without the prior  approval of Farmer Mac, the Agents shall not reallow
any portion of the commission or discount  payable pursuant hereto to investment
dealers  or  dealer  banks in  connection  with the  offer or sale of any  Notes
(whether  through  an  Agent as  principal  or to an  Agent  as  agent).  Unless
otherwise  approved  by  Farmer  Mac,  the  concession  will not be in excess of
66-2/3% of the  commission  or discount  received by such Agent from Farmer Mac.
Farmer Mac may rescind  such  authorization  by notice to the Agents at any time
prior to the acceptance of an offer with respect to such Note.

     2.  Representations and Warranties of Farmer Mac. Farmer Mac represents and
warrants to the Agents as of the date hereof,  as of the date of each acceptance
by Farmer Mac of an offer for the purchase of Notes (whether through an Agent as
principal  or to an Agent as agent),  as of the date of each  delivery  of Notes
(whether  through an Agent as  principal  or to an Agent as agent) and as of any
time that the Offering  Circular shall be amended or  supplemented or that there
is filed with  Securities and Exchange  Commission any document  incorporated by
reference  into the  Offering  Circular  (each of the dates or times  referenced
above is referred to herein as a "Representation Date") that:

     (a)  Farmer Mac is duly  organized  and  validly  existing  as a  federally
chartered instrumentality of the United States.

     (b) This  Agreement  has been duly  authorized,  executed and  delivered by
Farmer Mac.

     (c) The Notes have been duly  authorized by Farmer Mac, and each Note, when
its terms  have been  established,  and it has been  issued,  authenticated  and
delivered  pursuant to this  Agreement  and the Fiscal  Agency  Agreement,  will
constitute a valid and legally  binding  obligation of Farmer Mac enforceable in
accordance  with  its  terms,   subject,  as  to  enforcement,   to  bankruptcy,
insolvency,  receivership  (including  but not  limited  to 12 U.S.C.  Part 650,
Subpart C), reorganization and other laws of general  applicability  relating to
or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles, and in the case
of a Note the principal or interest of which is payable in a foreign currency or
a composite currency,  to provisions of law that may require that a judgment for
money damages rendered by a court in the United States be expressed only in U.S.
dollars.

     (d) The  Offering  Circular  does not  include  any untrue  statement  of a
material  fact or  omit  to  state  any  material  fact  necessary  to make  the
statements  therein,  in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not
misleading,  except  that the  foregoing  does not  apply  to  statements  in or
omissions from such document based upon written information  furnished to Farmer
Mac by any Agent specifically for use therein.

     (e) The documents  incorporated by reference in the Offering  Circular,  at
the time they were or  hereafter  are filed  with the  Securities  and  Exchange
Commission and at each  Representation  Date, complied or will comply as to form
in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"), and the rules and regulations thereunder.

     (f)  No  consent,   approval,   authorization,   order,   registration   or
qualification  of or  with  any  court  or any  regulatory  authority  or  other
governmental agency or body (including the Securities and Exchange  Commission),
except as may have otherwise been previously  obtained (other than in connection
or compliance  with the securities or "blue sky" laws of any  jurisdiction),  is
required for or in connection  with the issuance,  offer or sale of the Notes by
Farmer  Mac  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  this  Agreement  or  for  the
consummation of the  transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement,  the Fiscal
Agency Agreement, the Offering Circular or the Notes.

     Any  certificate  signed by any  director  or  officer  of  Farmer  Mac and
delivered to the Agents in connection  with an offering of the Notes or the sale
of the Notes to any of the Agents as principal shall be deemed a  representation
and  warranty by Farmer Mac to such Agent as to the matters  covered  thereby on
the date of such certificate and at each Representation Date subsequent thereto.

     3. Secondary  Market.  Each Agent will use its  reasonable  best efforts to
facilitate  secondary  market  transactions  in  the  Notes  purchased  by it as
principal or for which it was the Agent, and in so acting will do so for its own
account,  as principal,  and not as an agent of Farmer Mac. Each Agent also will
submit to Farmer Mac, as  requested  by Farmer Mac,  written  reports  regarding
secondary market transactions in the Notes. The form of such reports shall be as
reasonably  requested  by Farmer  Mac.  In such  reports,  the Agent will advise
Farmer Mac of the name and address of each  beneficial  purchaser  of Notes sold
through the Agent or of the line of business of each such beneficial  purchaser.
Each Agent also will advise Farmer Mac promptly of any material  development  in
the secondary market for the Notes.

     4.  Covenants  of Farmer  Mac and the  Agents.  Farmer  Mac and each  Agent
covenant and agree that:

     (a) Farmer Mac will amend or  supplement  the  Offering  Circular as it may
deem necessary or  appropriate.  Farmer Mac will furnish to the Agents copies of
the Offering Circular and amendments and supplements thereto, if any, as soon as
available  and in such  quantities  as each  Agent  to  receive  such  materials
reasonably  requests.  Farmer Mac will give each Agent reasonable advance notice
of any  such  amendments  or  supplements  (provided,  however,  that a  Pricing
Supplement  relating  to the sale of a  particular  Note or Notes  shall  not be
deemed to supplement the Offering Circular for purposes of this Section 4). Each
of the Agents  covenants that such Agent will distribute the most recently dated
Offering Circular provided to such Agent, including any amendments or applicable
supplements  thereto,  in connection  with any offer or sale of the Notes on the
initial  distribution  thereof,  unless otherwise  instructed by Farmer Mac by a
notice in accordance with Section 10 hereof.

     (b) If, at any time when the Offering  Circular is used in connection  with
the offer or sale of Notes contemplated  hereby and Farmer Mac has not suspended
solicitations  pursuant to Section 1(b) nor has this Agreement or the applicable
Terms  Agreement,  as the case may be,  been  terminated,  an event  occurs as a
result of which the Offering  Circular,  as then amended or supplemented,  would
include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
necessary  to make the  statements  therein,  in the light of the  circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading,  Farmer Mac promptly will advise the
Agents to suspend any solicitations of offers to purchase any Notes and delivery
of the Offering  Circular,  and promptly will prepare an amendment or supplement
to  the  Offering  Circular  that  will  correct  such  statement  or  omission.
Thereafter,  the Agents will deliver only such amended or supplemented  Offering
Circular.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  if an Agent has agreed to  purchase
Notes from Farmer Mac as principal,  Farmer Mac's obligations under this Section
4(b) will  terminate  thirty  (30) days after the date of the  applicable  Terms
Agreement  unless such Agent notifies Farmer Mac prior to the end of such 30-day
period that the  distribution  of such Notes has been  completed,  in which case
Farmer  Mac's   obligations  will  terminate  when  the  distribution  has  been
completed.  In addition,  the cost of complying  with the  requirements  of this
Section 4(b) with  respect to  offerings of Notes on a principal  basis shall be
borne (i)  during  the  60-day  period  after the date of the  applicable  Terms
Agreement, by Farmer Mac and (ii) after the expiration of such 60-day period, by
the applicable Agent.

     (c) On or prior to the date on which there shall be released to the general
public  financial  statement  information  related to Farmer Mac with respect to
financial  statements for other than any fiscal year, or  preliminary  financial
statement  information with respect to any fiscal year, Farmer Mac shall furnish
such  information  to each Agent and shall  cause the  Offering  Circular  to be
amended or  supplemented  to  include  or  incorporate  by  reference  financial
information  with  respect  thereto  and   corresponding   information  for  the
comparable  period  of  the  preceding  fiscal  year,  as  well  as  such  other
information and explanations as shall be necessary for an understanding thereof.

     (d) On or prior to the date on which there shall be released to the general
public financial  information  included in or derived from the audited financial
statements of Farmer Mac for the preceding  fiscal year,  Farmer Mac shall cause
the Offering Circular to be amended,  by the filing of documents pursuant to the
1934 Act or  otherwise,  to include or  incorporate  by  reference  such audited
financial  statements and the report or reports of the  independent  accountants
with respect  thereto,  as well as such other  information  and  explanations as
shall be necessary for an understanding of such financial statements.

     (e)  Farmer Mac will use its  reasonable  best  efforts to arrange  for the
qualification of the Notes for sale and the  determination of their  eligibility
for investment under the laws of such  jurisdictions in the United States as the
Agents reasonably may designate and will continue such  qualifications in effect
so long as required for the distribution of the Notes;  provided,  however, that
Farmer Mac shall not be required in connection therewith to qualify as a foreign
corporation, to execute a general consent to service of process or to take other
actions that would subject it to general or unlimited  service of process in any
jurisdiction  or  to  any  other   requirement  that  Farmer  Mac  deems  unduly
burdensome.  Farmer Mac will not have any responsibility or liability in respect
of the  legality of offering and selling the Notes in any  jurisdiction  outside
the United States or in respect of the use of any offering  circular relating to
the Notes in any  jurisdiction  outside the United  States or the  compliance of
such offering circular with the requirements of any such jurisdiction.

     (f) Farmer Mac will pay all expenses  incidental to the  performance of its
obligations  in  connection  with the  issuance and sale of the Notes under this
Agreement,  including the fees and expenses of accountants and legal counsel for
Farmer Mac and  expenses  relating to: (i) the  preparation  and delivery to the
Agents of the Notes;  (ii) the  registration or  qualification  of the Notes for
offer  and  sale  under  the  securities  or  "blue  sky"  laws  of the  various
jurisdictions   referred  to  in  Section   4(e)  above,   including   fees  and
disbursements of its counsel in connection therewith;  and (iii) the preparation
and  reproduction of the Offering  Circular,  including the reasonable  costs of
delivering  the  Offering  Circular to the Agents.  The Agents  shall pay all of
their own expenses,  including the fees and expenses of their counsel,  transfer
taxes and the fees and expenses  incurred in connection with any resale of Notes
purchased by any Agent as principal and any advertising  expenses connected with
any offers they may make.

     (g) Each time that the Offering Circular is amended or supplemented, Farmer
Mac will furnish the Agents with a certificate, dated the date of such amendment
or  supplement,  of  Farmer  Mac,  executed  on Farmer  Mac's  behalf by (i) the
President and Chief Executive Officer of Farmer Mac and (ii) a Vice President of
Farmer Mac, to the effect that the  representations and warranties of Farmer Mac
in this  Agreement  are true and  correct  as of the date of such  amendment  or
supplement and that since the respective dates as of which  information is given
(or  incorporated by reference) in the Offering  Circular,  as amended and other
than as set forth  therein,  there has not been any material  adverse  change in
Farmer Mac's financial position or results of operations.

     (h) Each time that the Offering Circular is amended or supplemented, Farmer
Mac will furnish the Agents with a written  opinion or opinions,  dated the date
of such  amendment or supplement,  of the Vice  President,  General  Counsel and
Secretary of Farmer Mac, to the effect that:

(i)  Farmer Mac is duly organized and validly existing as a federally  chartered
     instrumentality of the United States.

(ii) This Agreement has been duly  authorized,  executed and delivered by Farmer
     Mac.

(iii)The  Fiscal  Agency  Agreement  has  been  duly  authorized,  executed  and
     delivered  by Farmer  Mac and  constitutes  the valid and  legally  binding
     agreement of Farmer Mac, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject,
     as to enforcement, to bankruptcy,  insolvency,  receivership (including but
     not limited to 12 U.S.C.  Part 650, Subpart C),  reorganization,  and other
     laws of general  applicability  relating to or affecting  creditors' rights
     and to general equity principles.

(iv) The Notes have been duly  authorized by Farmer Mac; and each Note, when its
     terms  have been  established  and it has been  issued,  authenticated  and
     delivered pursuant to this Agreement and the Fiscal Agency Agreement,  will
     constitute a valid and binding  obligation  of Farmer Mac,  enforceable  in
     accordance  with its terms,  subject,  as to  enforcement,  to  bankruptcy,
     insolvency,  receivership (including but not limited to 12 U.S.C. Part 650,
     Subpart C), reorganization and other laws of general applicability relating
     to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles, and, in
     the case of a Note the  principal  or  interest  of which is  payable  in a
     foreign  currency or a composite  currency,  to  provisions of law that may
     require that a judgment for money damages rendered by a court in the United
     States be expressed only in U.S. dollars.

(v)  The  execution  and  delivery by Farmer Mac of this  Agreement,  the Fiscal
     Agency  Agreement and the Notes and the incurrence of the  obligations  and
     consummation  of the  transactions  contemplated  therein will not conflict
     with or constitute a breach of, or default under, the Charter Act or bylaws
     of  Farmer  Mac  or  any  material  contract,  indenture,   mortgage,  loan
     agreement,  note or lease  known to such  counsel to which  Farmer Mac is a
     party or by which it may be bound;  and Farmer Mac has full corporate power
     and authority to  authorize,  issue and sell the Notes as  contemplated  by
     this Agreement.

(vi) The issuance and sale of the Notes under the circumstances  contemplated by
     this Agreement and the Fiscal Agency Agreement do not require  registration
     of the Notes under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"),
     by reason of Section 3(a)(2) thereof,  or compliance with any provisions of
     the Trust  Indenture  Act of 1939,  as  amended,  by reason of Section  304
     thereof.

(vii)Farmer Mac is not, and will not become,  as a result of the consummation of
     the  transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement  and the Fiscal  Agency
     Agreement  or the  conducting  of its business as described in the Offering
     Circular,  subject to the provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940,
     as amended.

(viii) Farmer Mac is not required to register as an "investment  company" within
     the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

(ix) No consent, approval,  authorization,  order, registration or qualification
     of or with any  court or any  regulatory  authority  or other  governmental
     agency or body (including the Securities and Exchange  Commission),  except
     as may have otherwise been previously obtained (other than in connection or
     compliance with the securities or "blue sky" laws of any jurisdiction as to
     which  such  counsel  may  express  no  opinion),  is  required  for  or in
     connection  with the issuance,  offer or sale of the Notes by Farmer Mac in
     accordance with the terms of this Agreement or for the  consummation of the
     transactions  contemplated by this Agreement,  the Fiscal Agency Agreement,
     the Offering Circular or the Notes.

     Such  counsel also shall state that such  counsel has  participated  in the
preparation of the Offering Circular and the documents incorporated by reference
therein and that, while such counsel has not independently verified the accuracy
or  completeness  of the  information  contained  or  incorporated  by reference
therein,  based  on  such  counsel's  participation  in the  preparation  of the
Offering  Circular,  no facts have come to the attention of such counsel to lead
him to believe that the Offering  Circular (as then amended or supplemented,  if
then amended or supplemented), as of its date and as of the date of the opinion,
included or includes any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits
to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the  circumstances  under  which  they  were  made,  not  misleading;  it  being
understood  that such  counsel  need not comment on the section in the  Offering
Circular   under  the  caption   "Certain   United  States  Federal  Income  Tax
Considerations" or on the financial statements or other financial, accounting or
statistical  information or data contained or  incorporated  by reference in the
Offering Circular.

     In  rendering  such  opinion,  such  counsel  may  rely  (A) as to  matters
involving the  application  of laws other than the laws of the United States and
jurisdictions in which such counsel is admitted,  upon an opinion or opinions of
other  counsel  familiar with the  applicable  laws and (B) on  certificates  of
government officials in any jurisdiction.

     In lieu of such opinion or opinions,  counsel may furnish the Agents with a
letter or  letters to the  effect  that the  Agents may rely on a prior  opinion
delivered  under this  Section  4(h) to the same  extent as if it were dated the
date of such letter (except that statements in such prior opinion will relate to
the Offering Circular as amended or supplemented).

     (i) Farmer  Mac shall not be  required  to comply  with the  provisions  of
Section  4(a)  through  4(h) during any period from the time when Farmer Mac has
suspended  solicitations  pursuant  to  Section  1(b)  to the  time  Farmer  Mac
determines  that  solicitations  should be  resumed  or enters  into a new Terms
Agreement  with an Agent;  provided that during the time that (i) an Agent holds
any Notes purchased as principal  pursuant to a Terms Agreement or (ii) an offer
to  purchase  any of the Notes has been  accepted  by Farmer Mac but the time of
delivery to the purchaser  has not  occurred,  Farmer Mac shall comply with such
provisions  notwithstanding  the suspension of  solicitations;  provided further
that the expenses of complying with the requirements of this Section 4(i) in the
case of the  purchase  of Notes by an Agent  as  principal  pursuant  to a Terms
Agreement  shall be borne (i) during the  60-day  period  after the date of such
Terms  Agreement,  by Farmer Mac and (ii) after the  expiration  of such  60-day
period, by such Agent.

     Farmer Mac will  furnish  the  Agents  with such  conformed  copies of such
opinions, certificates, letters and documents as they may reasonably request.

     5. Conditions of the Agents'  Obligations.  The obligations of any Agent to
purchase Notes as principal  pursuant to a Terms  Agreement,  the obligations of
any Agent to solicit  offers to purchase  the Notes as agent of Farmer Mac,  the
obligations  of any purchasers of the Notes sold through any Agent as agent will
be subject to the accuracy of the  representations and warranties on the part of
Farmer Mac herein and to the performance and observance by Farmer Mac of all its
covenants and agreements herein contained.

     6. Indemnification

            (a) Farmer Mac agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Agent and
each person, if any, who controls any Agent within the meaning of Section 15 of
the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act as follows:

               (i)  against  any and all  loss,  liability,  claim,  damage  and
          expense whatsoever,  as incurred,  arising out of any untrue statement
          or alleged  untrue  statement  of a  material  fact  contained  in the
          Offering  Circular  (or any  amendment  thereto),  or the  omission or
          alleged  omission  therefrom of a material fact  necessary to make the
          statements therein in the light of the circumstances  under which they
          were made, not misleading;

               (ii)  against  any and all loss,  liability,  claim,  damage  and
          expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount
          paid  in  settlement  of  any  litigation,  or  the  investigation  or
          proceeding  by  any   governmental   agency  or  body,   commenced  or
          threatened,  or of any claim  whatsoever  based  upon any such  untrue
          statement  or  omission,  or any  such  alleged  untrue  statement  or
          omission,  if such  settlement is effected with the written consent of
          Farmer Mac; and

               (iii)  against  any  and  all  expense  whatsoever,  as  incurred
          (including  the  fees  and  disbursements  of  counsel  chosen  by the
          Agents), reasonably incurred in investigating,  preparing or defending
          against  any  litigation,   or  investigation  or  proceeding  by  any
          governmental  agency or body,  commenced or  threatened,  or any claim
          whatsoever  based upon any such  untrue  statement  or omission or any
          such alleged untrue statement or omission, to the extent that any such
          expense is not paid under (i) or (ii) above;

provided,  however,  that this indemnity  agreement shall not apply to any loss,
liability,  claim,  damage or expense to the  extent  arising  out of any untrue
statement or omission or alleged  untrue  statement or omission made in reliance
upon and in conformity  with written  information  furnished to Farmer Mac by an
Agent expressly for use in the Offering Circular (or any amendment or supplement
thereto).

     (b) Each Agent  agrees to  indemnify  and hold  harmless  Farmer  Mac,  its
directors, its officers, and each person, if any, who controls Farmer Mac within
the  meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act against
any  and all  loss,  liability,  claim,  damage  and  expense  described  in the
indemnity  contained in subsection (a) of this Section 6, as incurred,  but only
with respect to untrue statements or omissions,  or alleged untrue statements or
omissions  made  in the  Offering  Circular  (or  any  amendment  or  supplement
thereto),  in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished
to Farmer Mac by such Agent  expressly for use in the Offering  Circular (or any
amendment or supplement thereto).

     (c) Each  indemnified  party shall give prompt notice to each  indemnifying
party of any action  commenced  against it in respect of which  indemnity may be
sought  hereunder,  but  failure to so notify an  indemnifying  party  shall not
relieve such  indemnifying  party from any liability which it may have otherwise
than  on  account  of  this  indemnity  agreement.  An  indemnifying  party  may
participate at its own expense in the defense of such action.  In no event shall
the  indemnifying  parties be liable for the fees and  expenses of more than one
counsel  (in  addition  to any local  counsel)  for all  indemnified  parties in
connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the
same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances.

     7. Contribution. In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in
circumstances in which the indemnity  agreement provided for in Section 6 hereof
is for any reason held to be unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless the
indemnified parties although applicable in accordance with its terms, Farmer Mac
and the Agents shall contribute to the aggregate  losses,  liabilities,  claims,
damages and  expenses of the nature  contemplated  by such  indemnity  agreement
incurred  by Farmer  Mac and one or more of the  Agents,  as  incurred,  in such
proportions  that each Agent is responsible for that portion  represented by the
percentage that the total  commissions and  underwriting  discounts  received by
such Agent to the date of such liability bears to the total sales price from the
sale of Notes sold to or through such Agent to the date of such  liability,  and
Farmer Mac is responsible  for the balance;  provided,  however,  that no person
guilty of fraudulent  misrepresentation  (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of
the 1933 Act)  shall be  entitled  to  contribution  from any person who was not
guilty of such  fraudulent  misrepresentation.  For  purposes of this Section 7,
each  person,  if any, who controls an Agent within the meaning of Section 15 of
the  1933  Act or  Section  20 of the 1934 Act  shall  have the same  rights  to
contribution  as such Agent,  and each  director of Farmer Mac,  each officer of
Farmer Mac, and each person,  if any, who controls Farmer Mac within the meaning
of  Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same
rights to contribution as Farmer Mac.

      8. Termination.

     (a) Farmer Mac may terminate this Agreement (excluding any Terms Agreement)
for any reason at any time either in whole or as to any one or more Agents,  and
any Agent may terminate this Agreement (excluding any Terms Agreement),  insofar
as this Agreement relates to such Agent. In either case, such a termination will
be effective on the seventh day following  the giving of written  notice of such
termination  to the Agent or Farmer Mac, as the case may be (provided  that,  if
the notice of termination  states that the Agreement is being terminated because
of violation  of this  Agreement by the other  party,  the  termination  will be
effective upon the giving of the written notice). Any settlement with respect to
Notes placed by an Agent occurring after  termination of this Agreement shall be
made  as if  this  Agreement  had  not  been  terminated  with  respect  to such
settlement,  subject to Section 8(b) hereof, and each Agent agrees, if requested
by  Farmer  Mac,  to take the  steps  necessary  to be  taken  by such  Agent in
connection with such settlement.

     (b) An  Agent  shall  have the  right to  terminate  the  applicable  Terms
Agreement,  whether  oral or in  writing,  between  such Agent and Farmer Mac by
notice to Farmer  Mac at any time at or prior to the time of  settlement  on the
settlement date specified in such Terms Agreement in the event that,  subsequent
to the execution and delivery of such Terms Agreement, there shall have occurred
(i) a suspension or material  limitation  of trading in securities  generally on
the New York Stock  Exchange,  or any  setting of minimum  prices for trading on
such  exchange,  or any suspension of trading of any securities of Farmer Mac on
any  exchange  or  in  the  over-the-counter  market;  (ii)  a  general  banking
moratorium declared by the federal or New York authorities; or (iii) an outbreak
or material  escalation of hostilities in which the United States is involved or
other  substantial  calamity  or crisis  the  effect  of which on the  financial
markets of the United States is such as to make it, in the  reasonable  judgment
of such Agent, impracticable to market the Notes.

     (c) In the event of any such  termination,  no terminated  party shall have
any liability to the other parties hereto,  nor shall the terminating party have
any  liability to the  terminated  party (and,  if the  terminating  party is an
Agent, to any other Agent), except as provided in Section 9.

     9. Survival of Certain  Representations  and  Obligations.  The  respective
indemnities,  agreements,  representations,  and warranties of Farmer Mac and of
the Agents  herein,  or  contained  in  certificates  of  officers of Farmer Mac
submitted pursuant hereto,  will remain in full force and effect,  regardless of
any investigation,  or statement as to the results thereof, made by or on behalf
of any Agent,  or Farmer  Mac,  or any of its  officers  or  directors  and will
survive  delivery of and payment for the Notes.  If this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 8 or for any other reason,  the  respective  obligations  of
Farmer Mac and the Agents  pursuant to Sections 4(f) and 6 and 7 shall remain in
effect.  In addition,  if any such termination  shall occur after Farmer Mac has
accepted an offer to purchase  Notes and prior to the  related  settlement,  the
obligations of the applicable  Agent under Section 4(a) and the second  sentence
of the fourth  paragraph of Section 1(b) and of Farmer Mac under  Sections 1(d),
4(a),  4(b),  4(c) and 4(d) also shall remain in effect until the Notes are sold
by such Agent.

     10.  Notices.  Unless  otherwise  provided  herein,  all  notices and other
communications  hereunder  shall be in writing  and shall be deemed to have been
duly given if mailed,  delivered  or telexed and  confirmed  in writing by means
reasonably  calculated  to result in  delivery on the next  business  day to the
address specified below:

or, in the case of any party  hereto,  to such  other  address or person as such
party shall specify to each other party by a notice given in accordance with the
provisions  of this Section 10. Any such notice shall take effect at the time of
receipt.

     11. Successors.  This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding
upon the parties  hereto and their  respective  successors  (and,  to the extent
provided in Sections 6 and 7, the officers and directors and controlling persons
referred  to in  Sections 6 and 7), and no other  person  will have any right or
obligation  hereunder.  No purchaser of any Notes as such will be deemed to be a
successor of any party hereto,  and this Agreement will not inure to the benefit
of the holders of Notes by reason of their status as such.

     12. Assignment.  This Agreement shall not be assignable by any party hereto
without the express written consent of the counterparty.

     13. Farmer Mac's Sales of Notes.  Farmer Mac may offer and sell,  from time
to time or continuously,  any notes or other securities, in any manner and to or
through  any  person,  without  the  consent  of any  Agent,  whether  in a firm
commitment underwriting pursuant to an underwriting agreement, through a selling
group, through Agents, or otherwise.

     14. Agreements of Agents.  (a) Each Agent  represents,  warrants and agrees
that such Agent and its  Affiliates  will comply with the Guidelines on Delivery
of  Offering   Materials   Relating  to   Securities   of   Government-Sponsored
Enterprises, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit C (the "Guidelines"),
and will maintain quality control procedures relating to its compliance with the
Guidelines.  The phrase "as soon as it is available",  as used in Paragraph 2 of
the Guidelines  with respect to delivery of the Offering  Circular by such Agent
and its Affiliates to purchasers during the applicable  Distribution  Period (as
defined in the Guidelines),  shall mean that such action shall be taken as shall
be necessary to ensure that the Offering  Circular is delivered to purchasers of
Notes  promptly  following  the  receipt  thereof by such Agent and in any event
before settlement of such Notes. The term "Offering  Documentation",  as used in
the  Guidelines,  means the Offering  Circular  (but not including the documents
incorporated by reference  therein).  Each Agent agrees to indemnify Farmer Mac,
its directors,  its officers,  and each person,  if any, who controls Farmer Mac
within  the  meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act
against any and all loss, liability,  claim, damage and expense that any of them
may incur or that may be made against any of them arising out of, or in relation
to, or in connection with, the failure by such Agent or any of its Affiliates to
observe or comply with any of the  restrictions or requirements  contemplated in
this paragraph.

     (b) In  connection  with the  offering  and sale of the  Notes,  each Agent
represents,  warrants  and agrees that it has  complied and will comply with the
applicable  law  of  any  jurisdiction,   including,   without  limitation,  any
applicable  laws,  rules or  regulations,  and with any selling or  solicitation
restriction set forth in the Offering Circular at the time relating to the Notes
and any applicable supplement thereto.

     15. Sales of Notes Denominated in a Currency Other Than U.S. Dollars. If at
any time Farmer Mac  determines to issue and sell,  and any Agent  determines to
purchase or solicit  offers to purchase,  Notes  denominated in a currency other
than U.S. dollars, which other currency may include a composite currency, Farmer
Mac and such Agent may execute  and  deliver to one  another a Foreign  Currency
Amendment  establishing,  as appropriate,  additions to and modifications of the
terms of this Agreement with respect to such Notes.

     16.  Amendment.  This Agreement and the Exhibits hereto may be amended only
by written agreement of Farmer Mac and all of the Agents party to this Agreement
at such time.

     17.  Applicable  Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance  with, the laws of the State of New York applicable to contracts made
and to be performed therein.

     18. Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the
parties hereto in any number of  counterparts,  each of which shall be deemed to
be an original,  but all such respective  counterparts together shall constitute

Guidelines on Delivery of Offering Materials Relating to GSE Securities*

The  following  guidelines  (the  "Guidelines")  have been  established  for the
distribution of offering materials to investors in securities issued by the Farm
Credit  System,  the Federal  Home Loan Bank  System,  the Federal  Agricultural
Mortgage Corporation,  the Federal Home Loan Mortgage  Corporation,  the Federal
National Mortgage Association and the Student Loan Marketing  Association (each,
an  "Issuer").  The  purpose of these  Guidelines  is to  facilitate  the timely
distribution of information to purchasers of Securities (as defined herein). All
firms  participating  in the  distribution  of Securities are expected to follow
these Guidelines. Certain capitalized terms used in these Guidelines are defined
in paragraph 6.

     1.   Each  Principal  Dealer for  Securities  being  issued by an  Issuer**
          should  request,  as promptly as  practicable,  that the Issuer or its
          agent  deliver to the  Principal  Dealer (or, if the Issuer  agrees to
          distribute  Offering  Documentation to other Dealers, to such Dealers)
          before  settlement for that Security,  a specific  number of copies of
          the Offering  Documentation.  The Principal Dealer should consult with
          each  Dealer  to whom  the  Principal  Dealer  intends  to  sell  such
          Securities during the applicable  Distribution  Period,  and each such
          Dealer  should  consult  with each  Dealer to whom it  intends to sell
          Securities during the applicable  Distribution  Period, to ensure that
          the number of copies the  Principal  Dealer  requests  from the Issuer
          includes a quantity  deemed  adequate  by each  Dealer to satisfy  its
          obligations  under these  Guidelines.  Each Issuer or its agent should
          deliver the number of copies of the Offering  Documentation  requested
          pursuant to this  paragraph,  and should  deliver,  if requested,  any
          documents  incorporated by reference in such Offering Documentation to
          the Principal  Dealer  requesting  such  documents  (or, if the Issuer
          agrees to distribute Offering  Documentation to other Dealers, to such
          Dealers). Nothing herein shall be construed to prevent an Issuer and a
          Principal Dealer from agreeing to any other  arrangements with respect
          to the responsibility for duplication of Offering Documentation.  Each
          Principal  Dealer should  deliver to the Dealers to whom the Principal
          Dealer sells Securities during the applicable  Distribution Period the
          number of copies of the Offering  Documentation  requested pursuant to
          this  paragraph,  unless the Issuer  agrees to deliver  such copies to
          such Dealers.

     2.   During the applicable  Distribution  Period, each Dealer participating
          in a  distribution  of  Securities  should  deliver  or  cause  to  be
          delivered the applicable  Offering  Documentation  to each offeree who
          requests such documentation and to each person or entity who purchases
          Securities  from the Dealer.  The Dealer should  deliver such Offering
          Documentation   to  each  purchaser  of  the  Securities   during  the
          applicable  Distribution  Period  as soon as it is  available.  If the
          Dealer  decides  to send a  Confirmation  before  all of the  Offering
          Documentation   is   available,   the  Dealer   should  note  on  such
          Confirmation  that if not  previously  provided or enclosed,  Offering
          Documentation  will  follow.  In  addition,  any Dealer who receives a
          request from any offeree or purchaser  for documents  incorporated  by
          reference in the Offering  Documentation should provide such documents
          to such offeree or purchaser or provide  information  on how to obtain
          such documents from the Issuer. If a Dealer has previously furnished a
          purchaser  who is not a  Dealer  with  all or some  of the  applicable
          Offering Documentation in connection with an earlier transaction,  the
          Dealer  need  not  furnish  another  copy of the  material  previously
          furnished unless the purchaser requests an additional copy.

          pool  information  is  available  to  each  purchaser  by  telephoning
          1-800-879-FARM for the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation.

     4.   All  Dealers  in  Securities  who  sell  such  Securities  during  the
          Distribution  Period should establish  written policies and procedures
          to implement these Guidelines.

     5.   Each Dealer should  designate one or more contact  persons or units as
          responsible for the  distribution of Offering  Documentation  and make
          the name of such contact  persons or units  available to other Dealers
          with whom it does  business in the purchase and sale of  Securities to
          ensure   efficient   communication   among  Dealers   concerning   the
          distribution of Offering  Documentation  for  Securities.  Each Issuer
          should also designate one or more contact persons or units responsible
          for distribution of Offering Documentation for Securities.

     NOW,  THEREFORE,  in  consideration  of the  premises  and  other  good and

     Section 2.  Description  of the Discount  Notes.  The Discount  Notes shall

discount  from  their face  amount.  Farmer  Mac will  offer  Discount  Notes in
book-entry  form through the Fed Book-Entry  System in minimum amounts of $1,000
and additional integral multiples thereof.  Farmer Mac will offer Discount Notes
having maturities of one year or less from their date of issue.

     The face amount of each Discount  Note will be payable on a Maturity  Date.
Farmer Mac will not offer a Discount  Note having a Maturity Date on a day other
than a day  expected  to be a Business  Day.  Farmer Mac  reserves  the right to
advise the Discount  Note Dealer Group by telephone of other dates that will not
be acceptable as a Maturity Date for the Discount Notes.

     Although Farmer Mac may borrow up to  $1,500,000,000  from the Secretary of
the  Treasury,  subject to  certain  restrictions,  to enable it to fulfill  its
guarantee  obligations,  Farmer Mac may not  borrow  from  Treasury  to pay debt
obligations, such as the Discount Notes issued by Farmer Mac. The Discount Notes
will be  obligations  of Farmer  Mac only and are not  guaranteed  by and do not
constitute  debts or obligations of the Farm Credit  Administration,  the United
States or any agency or  instrumentality  thereof other than Farmer Mac.  Income
from the Discount Notes has no exemption from federal,  and no federal exemption
from  state  or  local,  taxation.  The  Discount  Notes  are  exempt  from  the
registration  requirements of the Securities Act. The Discount Notes will not be
issued  under an  indenture,  and no trustee  is  provided  with  respect to the
Discount Notes.

     Farmer Mac has entered into a Fiscal Agency Agreement,  dated as of June 1,
1996 (the "Fiscal Agency Agreement"), with the Federal Reserve Banks pursuant to
which the Federal  Reserve  Banks will act as fiscal agents  (collectively,  the
"Fiscal  Agent")  with  respect  to the  Discount  Notes.  Farmer Mac will issue
Discount  Notes and establish  their terms from time to time in accordance  with
the  provisions  of a Master Terms  Agreement,  dated as of July 1, 1996,  among
Farmer  Mac and  the  Holders  of the  Discount  Notes  and  the  Fiscal  Agency
Agreement.

     Section 3. Pricing  Procedures.  From time to time,  Farmer Mac will notify
Dealer as to the approximate amount of Discount Notes to be sold during a stated
period and will, in connection with authorizing  Dealer to proceed with offering
such Discount Notes to the public, notify Dealer as to the aggregate face amount
of  Discount  Notes to be  offered,  the  applicable  Maturity  Date(s) for such
Discount Notes and the Discount Rate(s) applicable to Discount Notes having such
Maturity Date(s). Farmer Mac will give such information by telephone to Dealer's
designated  representative.  Dealer  will  apprise  Farmer Mac of any  pertinent
market conditions that may affect the marketing of the Discount Notes and of the
status of  Dealer's  marketing  efforts and will,  upon  request,  provide  rate
recommendations to Farmer Mac.

     Farmer Mac reserves the right,  in its sole  discretion  and without  prior
notice to Dealer,  to: (i) reject any offer for the purchase of Discount  Notes;
(ii) allot less than the face amount of Discount Notes  requested by Dealer;  or
(iii)  terminate  the sale of Discount  Notes at any time prior to completion of
the sale on the Trade Date; provided,  however,  that Farmer Mac agrees that, in
the event  that  Farmer  Mac  takes any such  actions,  it will as  promptly  as
practicable  give Dealer notice  thereof.  Farmer Mac reserves the right, in its
sole  discretion  and with prior notice to Dealer,  to change the Discount  Rate
then  applicable to unissued  Discount Notes of any Maturity Date. The foregoing
is subject to the  limitation  that,  in the event that  Farmer Mac  confirms by
telephone its acceptance of an offer to purchase any Discount Note in accordance
with Section 5 hereof, Farmer Mac shall be obligated to proceed with such sale.

     Section  4.  Offering  Procedures.  Dealer  shall  offer  for sale and sell
Discount Notes purchased under this Agreement at the appropriate  Discount Rates
for the appropriate Maturity Dates as specified by Farmer Mac in accordance with
Section 3 hereof. Subject to the prior approval of Farmer Mac, Dealer may accept
orders for delayed  delivery.  Without the express  authorization of Farmer Mac,
Dealer may not purchase  Discount Notes sold by Farmer Mac to Dealer for its own
account under this  Agreement.  Dealer may purchase  Discount  Notes for its own
account following the commencement of trading of Discount Notes in the secondary
market.

     Section 5.  Transmittal  of Orders and  Acceptance  of Offers for  Discount
Notes. Dealer will advise a designated representative of Farmer Mac by telephone
of offers to purchase  Discount Notes for either immediate or delayed  delivery.
Dealer shall  confirm  such offers with Farmer Mac as to face  amount,  Discount
Rate,  date of issue and Maturity Date, and Farmer Mac shall promptly  accept or
reject any such offer to purchase. Farmer Mac shall have no obligation to accept
any offer to purchase  Discount Notes prior to its telephone  acceptance of such
offer.  Farmer Mac's telephone  acceptance of an offer shall bind Farmer Mac and
Dealer to proceed with such sale in  accordance  with the terms as so confirmed.
Such  confirmation  shall  occur on the Trade Date.  Telephone  offers for "cash
sales"  shall be given to Farmer Mac not later than  11:00  a.m.,  New York City
time, on the Trade Date, and all telephone  offers for "forward  sales" shall be
given to Farmer Mac not later than 3:00 p.m.,  New York City time,  on the Trade
Date. For purposes of this  Agreement,  a "cash sale" is a sale in which payment
for,  and issuance  of, the related  Discount  Note is made on the Trade Date; a
"forward  sale" is a sale in which  payment  for,  and  issuance of, the related
Discount Note is made on a Business Day after the Trade Date. A uniform delivery
instruction  form  satisfactory to Farmer Mac shall be provided to Farmer Mac by
Dealer.

     Section 6. Issuance of and Payment for Discount  Notes.  The Discount Notes
shall be issued and may be redeemed by Farmer Mac. Issuance of, and payment for,
Discount Notes shall occur by approximately 2:00 p.m., New York City time on the
Settlement Date. Delivery of the Discount Notes shall be made against payment of
the  purchase  price  therefor in  immediately  available  funds  payable to the
account of Farmer Mac through the Fed  Book-Entry  System.  Failure of Dealer to
make payment on the  Settlement  Date for the Discount  Notes allotted to Dealer
shall result in a charge to Dealer for accrued  interest on the aggregate unpaid
principal of the Discount Notes for which payment was not made on the Settlement
Date,  calculated  on a daily basis to the date of payment,  at a per annum rate
equal to: (i) the Discount Rate  applicable to such Discount Notes plus (ii) the
concession to Dealer as described in Section 7 herein;  provided,  however, that
no such  charge will be made to Dealer in the event that (A) Farmer Mac fails to
deliver  the  Discount  Notes on the  Settlement  Date,  or (B) Dealer  fails to
receive the Discount  Notes by 3:00 p.m. on the  Settlement  Date.  In the event
settlement does not occur on the date otherwise scheduled  therefor,  settlement
shall be  automatically  rescheduled  for the  following  Business  Day.  On the
Maturity  Date,  Farmer Mac will make payment of the face amount of the Discount
Notes by prompt payment of immediately  available  funds to the Fiscal Agent for
prompt  payment  to the  Holder of the  Discount  Notes.  In the event  that the
Maturity Date for a Discount Note is not a Business Day, the Maturity Date shall
be the next succeeding Business Day.

     Section 7. Concession. Farmer Mac agrees to allow a concession to Dealer of
.05% of the face amount of the Discount Notes sold by Dealer.  Dealer may deduct
the amount of the concession  from the gross amount owed to Farmer Mac by Dealer
in respect of such Discount Notes. The concession may be withheld in whole or in
part as to Dealer at Farmer Mac's  discretion  upon Farmer  Mac's  determination
that the  offering or sale of Discount  Notes by Dealer is in  violation  of the
terms hereof or is otherwise  improper.  No other  concessions  or other amounts
will be paid to Dealer.  The amount of the  concession  may be changed by Farmer
Mac from time to time in its sole discretion.  Farmer Mac shall notify Dealer at
least five (5) Business Days prior to the effective date of any such change.

     Section 8. Secondary Market. Dealer shall use its best efforts to offer for
sale and to sell Discount Notes  purchased  under this Agreement and to maintain
an orderly secondary market for the Discount Notes. Dealer agrees to provide, on
a continuous  basis, bid and ask prices for the Discount Notes and to quote such
prices in the secondary market. All such prices shall be quoted by observing the
standards  and  principles  of the industry and at a price that is fair,  taking
into  consideration all relevant  circumstances,  including market conditions at
the time of the transaction regarding the Discount Notes and similar securities.
Any bid and ask price  quoted by Dealer may be published by Farmer Mac. No later
than the fifth Business Day of each month,  Dealer shall submit a written report
to Farmer Mac, in a form mutually  acceptable  to Farmer Mac and Dealer,  of its
purchases  and  sales of  Discount  Notes in the  secondary  market  during  the
previous month. Dealer shall also be responsible for continually advising Farmer
Mac of conditions  and  developments  in the  secondary  market that may have an
effect on the price or marketability of the Discount Notes.

     Section 9. Offering Material.  Dealer will not make any  representations or
give any  information  in connection  with the offering and sale of the Discount
Notes other than those contained in the current Offering  Circular and any other
descriptive  materials  relating to the Notes (a)  furnished to Dealer by Farmer
Mac or (b) approved by Farmer Mac in writing prior to their use.

     Dealer  represents,  warrants  and  agrees  that  Dealer  (and  any  of its
affiliates)  will comply with the  Guidelines on Delivery of Offering  Materials
Relating to Securities of Government-Sponsored  Enterprises,  a copy of which is
attached  hereto as  Exhibit A (the  "Guidelines"),  and will  maintain  quality
control  procedures  relating to its compliance with the Guidelines.  The phrase
"as soon as it is  available,"  as used in  Paragraph 2 of the  Guidelines  with
respect to delivery of the Offering Circular by such Dealer (and its affiliates)
to  purchasers  during the  applicable  Distribution  Period (as  defined in the
Guidelines), shall mean that such action shall be taken as shall be necessary to
ensure that the Offering  Circular is delivered to purchasers of Discount  Notes
promptly  following  the  receipt  thereof  by Dealer  and in any  event  before
settlement of such Discount Notes. The term "Offering Documentation," as used in
the  Guidelines,  means the Offering  Circular  (but not including the documents
incorporated by reference  therein).  Dealer agrees to indemnify Farmer Mac, its
directors, its officers, and each person, if any, who controls Farmer Mac within
the meaning of Section 15 of the  Securities  Act or Section 20 of the  Exchange
Act against any and all loss,  liability,  claim, damage and expense that any of
them may incur or that may be made  against  any of them  arising  out of, or in
relation  to, or in  connection  with,  the  failure  by  Dealer  (or any of its
affiliates) to observe or comply with any of the  restrictions  or  requirements
contemplated in this paragraph.

     Section 10. Expenses.  Farmer Mac shall pay all expenses incurred by Farmer
Mac in  connection  with  the  matters  contemplated  by this  Agreement  and in
connection with the matters herein to be performed by Farmer Mac,  including all
expenses in connection with the preparation,  printing and delivery to Dealer of
the  Offering  Circular  and  the  fees  and  expenses  of its own  counsel  and
accountants. Dealer shall have no authority to obligate Farmer Mac or the Fiscal
Agent for any  expenses  incurred by Dealer.  Farmer Mac shall not be liable for
any  expenses  incurred by Dealer in  connection  with the  purchase and sale of
Discount  Notes,  and  Dealer  agrees  to  pay  its  expenses  relating  to  the
performance of its obligations under this Agreement.

     Section 11.  Maturity  Schedule.  Farmer Mac will  maintain a record of the
aggregate face amount of Discount Notes  outstanding,  each future Maturity Date
of  outstanding  Discount  Notes and the aggregate face amount of Discount Notes
due on each such Maturity Date. When requested, Farmer Mac will advise Dealer of
such amounts and dates.

Mac.

          for complying with such laws,  notwithstanding  any information  which
          may be  furnished  by  Farmer  Mac  relating  to this  matter.  Dealer
          represents  and warrants that Dealer is and shall remain in compliance
          with the laws of any  jurisdiction  in which Dealer sells,  offers for

          licensed as a broker or dealer in such jurisdiction  unless Dealer and
          its relevant representatives are so registered or licensed.

               (iii)By  execution of this Agreement,  Dealer has received a copy
          of the then current Offering Circular.

          Circular or in any documents incorporated therein by reference.

          (b) Farmer Mac hereby represents,  warrants and covenants to Dealer as
     of the date  hereof  and as of each  Trade  Date and  Settlement  Date with
     respect to an offering of Discount Notes that:

               (i)  Farmer  Mac is duly  organized  and  validly  existing  as a
          federally chartered instrumentality of the United States.

               (ii)  This  Agreement  has been  duly  authorized,  executed  and
          delivered by Farmer Mac.

               (iii)The  Discount Notes have been duly authorized by Farmer Mac,
          and each Discount Note, when its terms have been  established,  and it
          has  been  issued,   authenticated  and  delivered  pursuant  to  this
          Agreement and the Fiscal Agency Agreement, will constitute a valid and
          legally  binding  obligation of Farmer Mac  enforceable  in accordance
          with its terms, subject, as to enforcement, to bankruptcy, insolvency,
          reorganization and other laws of general applicability  relating to or
          affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles.

               (iv) The Offering Circular (including the documents  incorporated
          by  reference  therein)  does not  include any untrue  statement  of a
          material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
          statements  therein,  in light of the circumstances in which they were
          made, not misleading.

               (v) No consent, approval,  authorization,  order, registration or
          qualification  of or with any  court or any  regulatory  authority  or
          other  governmental  agency  or body  (including  the  Securities  and
          Exchange  Commission),  except as may have otherwise  been  previously
          obtained  (other than in connection or compliance  with the securities
          or  "blue  sky"  laws  of any  jurisdiction),  is  required  for or in
          connection  with the issuance,  offer or sale of the Discount Notes by
          Farmer Mac in accordance  with the terms of this  Agreement or for the
          consummation of the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement,  the
          Fiscal Agency Agreement, the Offering Circular or the Discount Notes.

     Section 13. Indemnification. Dealer agrees to indemnify and hold Farmer Mac
harmless from and against any losses, liabilities, damages or claims (or actions
in respect  thereof)  to which it may  become  subject  insofar as such  losses,
liabilities,  damages or claims (or actions in respect  thereof) arise out of or
relate to the making by Dealer of any  representation or the giving by Dealer of
any  information  in connection  with the offering or sale of the Discount Notes
that is not  contained  in the Offering  Circular,  the  documents  incorporated
therein  by  reference,  and any  other  descriptive  material  relating  to the
Discount  Notes  furnished  to Dealer by Farmer Mac or approved by Farmer Mac in

any legal or other expense reasonably  incurred by Farmer Mac in connection with
investigation of or defending any such losses,  liabilities,  damages, claims or

incorporated  by  reference  therein,  or  arises  out of or is  based  upon the

Circular.  Dealer's obligation under this Section 13 shall be in addition to any
liability that Dealer may otherwise  have and shall extend,  upon the same terms

Dealer under this Agreement.

(Multicurrency-Cross Border)

                                     ISDA(R)

                 International Swap Dealers Association. Inc.

                                MASTER AGREEMENT

                            dated as of June 26, 1997

     Zions First National Bank and Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation

have entered and/or anticipate  entering into one or more  transactions  (each a
"Transaction")  that are or will be  governed by this  Master  Agreement,  which
includes the schedule (the  "Schedule"),  and the documents and other confirming
evidence (each a "Confirmation")  exchanged between the parties confirming those
Transactions.

Accordingly, the parties agree as follows:

     1. Interpretation

(a)  Definitions.  The terms defined in Section 14 and in the Schedule will have
the meanings therein specified for the purpose of this Master Agreement.

(b) Inconsistency.  In the event of any inconsistency  between the provisions of
the Schedule and the other  provisions  of this Master  Agreement,  the Schedule
will prevail.  In the event of any  inconsistency  between the provisions of any
Confirmation   and  this  Master  Agreement   (including  the  Schedule),   such
Confirmation will prevail for the purpose of the relevant Transaction.

(c) Single Agreement.  All Transactions are entered into in reliance on the fact
that this Master Agreement and all Confirmations form a single agreement between
the parties (collectively referred to as this -Agreement), and the parties would
not otherwise enter into any Transactions.

     2. Obligations

(a) General Conditions.

     (i) Each  party  will make  each  payment  or  delivery  specified  in each
     Confirmation  to be made by it,  subject  to the other  provisions  of this
     Agreement.

     (ii) Payments  under this  Agreement will be made on the due date for value
     on  that  date  in the  place  or the  account  specified  in the  relevant
     Confirmation   or  otherwise   pursuant  to  this   Agreement,   in  freely
     transferable funds and in the manner customary for payments in the required
     currency. Where settlement is by delivery (that is, other than by payment),
     such  delivery  will be made  for  receipt  on the due  date in the  manner
     customary for the relevant  obligation  unless  otherwise  specified in the
     relevant Confirmation or elsewhere in this Agreement.

     (iii) Each obligation of each party under Section 2(a)(i) is subject to (1)
     the  condition  precedent  that no Event of Default or  Potential  Event of
     Default with respect to the other party has occurred and is continuing, (2)
     the condition  precedent that no Early  Termination  Date in respect of the
     relevant  Transaction has occurred or been  effectively  designated and (3)
     each other applicable condition precedent specified in this Agreement.

(b) Change of  Account.  Either  party may change its  account  for  receiving a
payment  or  delivery  by giving  notice to the other  party at least five Local
Business Days prior to the  scheduled  date for the payment or delivery to which
such change  applies unless such other party gives timely notice of a reasonable
objection to such change.

(c) Netting. If on any date amounts would otherwise be payable:-

      (i) in the same currency; and

      (ii) in respect of the same Transaction.

by each party to the other,  then, on such date, each party's obligation to make
payment of any such amount will be  automatically  satisfied and discharged and,
if the  aggregate  amount that would  otherwise  have been  payable by one party
exceeds the aggregate amount that would otherwise have been payable by the other
party,  replaced by an  obligation  upon the party by whom the larger  aggregate
amount  would  have been  payable  to pay to the other  party the  excess of the
larger aggregate amount over the smaller aggregate amount.

The parties may elect in respect of two or more  Transactions  that a net amount
will be  determined  in respect of all  amounts  payable on the same date in the
same  currency  in  respect of such  Transactions,  regardless  of whether  such
amounts are payable in respect of the same Transaction. The election may be made
in the Schedule or a Confirmation  by specifying  that  subparagraph  (ii) above
will not apply to the Transactions  identified as being subject to the election,
together with the starting date (in which case subparagraph (ii) above will not,
or will cease to, apply to such  Transactions from such date). This election may
be  made  separately  for  different  groups  of  Transactions  and  will  apply
separately to each pairing of Offices through which the parties make and receive
payments or deliveries.

(d)   Deduction or Withholding for Tax.

     (i) Gross-Up.  All payments  under this  Agreement will be made without any
     deduction or withholding for or on account of any Tax unless such deduction
     or  withholding  is  required  by any  applicable  law,  as modified by the
     practice of any relevant governmental revenue authority, then in effect. If
     a party is so required to deduct or withhold, then that party ("X") will:

          (1) promptly notify the other party ("Y") of such requirement;

          (2) pay to the  relevant  authorities  the full amount  required to be
          deducted  or  withheld  (including  the  full  amount  required  to be
          deducted or withheld from any  additional  amount paid by X to Y under
          this Section 2(d)) promptly upon the culler of  determining  that such
          deduction or  withholding  is required or  receiving  notice that such
          amount has been assessed against Y;

          (3) promptly  forward to Y an official  receipt (or a certified copy),
          or other  documentation  reasonably  acceptable to Y,  evidencing such
          payment to such authorities; and

     (4) if such Tax is an  Indemnif`iable  Tax,  pay to Y, in  addition  to the
     payment  to  which Y is  otherwise  entitled  under  this  Agreement,  such
     additional  amount as is necessary  to ensure that the net amount  actually
     received  by Y (free and clear of  Indemnifiable  Taxes,  whether  assessed
     against X or Y) will  equal the full  amount Y would have  received  had no
     such  deduction  or  withholding  been  required.  However,  X will  not be
     required to pay any additional  amount to Y to the extent that it would not
     be required to be paid but for:

                    (A) the failure by Y to comply with or perform any agreement
               contained in Section 4(a)(i), 4(a)(iii) or 4(d); or

     (B) the failure of a  representation  made by Y pursuant to Section 3(f) to
be accurate and true unless such failure would not have occurred but for (I) any
action  taken  by a  taxing  authority,  or  brought  in a  court  of  competent
jurisdiction,  on or after  the  date on which a  Transaction  is  entered  into
(regardless  of whether  such action is taken or brought with respect to a party
to this Agreement) or (II) a Change in Tax Law.

(ii) Liability. If:-

(1) X is required  by any  applicable  law,  as modified by the  practice of any
relevant governmental revenue authority, to make any deduction or withholding in
respect of which X would not be required to pay an additional  amount to Y under
Section 2(d)(i)(4);

(2) X does not so deduct or withhold; and

(3) a liability resulting from such Tax is assessed directly against X,

then,  except to the extent Y has  satisfied  or then  satisfies  the  liability
resulting  from such Tax, Y will promptly pay to X the amount of such  liability
(including  any  related  liability  for  interest,  but  including  any related
liability  for  penalties  only if Y has failed to comply  with or  perform  any
agreement contained in Section 4(a)(i), 4(a)(iii) or 4(d)).

(e) Default  Interest;  Other  Amounts.  Prior to the  occurrence  or  effective
designation of an Early Termination Date in respect of the relevant Transaction,
a party that defaults in the performance of any payment  obligation will, to the
extent permitted by law and subject to Section 6(c), be required to pay interest
(before as well as after  judgment) on the overdue  amount to the other party on
demand in the same  currency as such  overdue  amount,  for the period from (and
including)  the  original  due date for payment to (but  excluding)  the date of
actual  payment,  at the Default  Rate.  Such interest will be calculated on the
basis of daily  compounding and the actual number of days elapsed.  If, prior to
the occurrence or effective  designation of an Early Termination Date in respect
of  the  relevant  Transaction,  a  party  defaults  in the  performance  of any
obligation  required to be settled by  delivery,  it will  compensate  the other
party on demand if and to the extent  provided for in the relevant  Confirmation
or elsewhere in this Agreement.



3.    Representations

Each party represents to the other party (which  representations  will be deemed
to be repeated by each party on each date on which a Transaction is entered into
and, in the case of the  representations in Section 3(f), at all times until the
termination of this Agreement) that:

(a)   Basic Representations.

     under this  Agreement and any  obligations  it has under any Credit Support
     Document  to which it is a party  and has  taken  all  necessary  action to
     authorise such execution, delivery and performance;

     (iii) No Violation or Conflict. Such execution, delivery and performance do
     not violate or conflict with any law applicable to it, any provision of its
     constitutional  documents,  any  order or  judgment  of any  court or other
     agency  of  government  applicable  to it or  any  of  its  assets  or  any
     contractual restriction binding on or affecting it or any of its assets;

     (iv)  Consents.  All  governmental  and other consents that are required to

     force and effect and all conditions of any such consents have been complied
     with; and

     moratorium  or similar  laws  affecting  creditors'  rights  generally  and
     subject,  as  to  enforceability,   to  equitable   principles  of  general
     application (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in
     equity or at law)).

(b) Absence of Certain Events. No Event of Default or Potential Event of Default
or, to its knowledge,  Termination  Event with respect to it has occurred and is
continuing  and no such  event or  circumstance  would  occur as a result of its
entering into or performing its  obligations  under this Agreement or any Credit
Support Document to which it is a party.

(c) Absence of Litigation. There is not pending or, to its knowledge, threatened
against it or any of its Affiliates any action,  suit or proceeding at law or in
equity or before any court,  tribunal,  governmental body, agency or official or
any arbitrator that is likely to affect the legality, validity or enforceability
against it of this  Agreement  or any Credit  Support  Document to which it is a
party or its ability to perform its  obligations  under this  Agreement  or such
Credit Support Document.

(d)  Accuracy of  Specified  Information.  All  applicable  information  that is
furnished in writing by or on behalf of it to the other party and is  identified
for the purpose of this  Section  3(d) in the Schedule is, as of the date of the
information, true, accurate and complete in every material respect.

(e) Payer Tax Representation.  Each representation  specified in the Schedule as
being made by it for the purpose of this Section 3(e) is accurate and true.

(f) Payee Tax Representations.  Each representation specified in the Schedule as
being made by it for the purpose of this Section 3(f) is accurate and true.

4. Agreements

any obligation under this Agreement or under any Credit Support Document to
which it is a party:

(a) Furnish  Specified  Information.  It will  deliver to the other party or, in
certain  cases under  subparagraph  (iii) below,  to such  government  or taxing
authority as the other party reasonably directs:

(i) any forms,  documents or certificates  relating to taxation specified in the
Schedule or any Confirmation;

(ii) any other documents specified in the Schedule or any Confirmation; and

(iii) upon reasonable  demand by such other party, any form or document that may
be  required  or  reasonably  requested  in writing in order to allow such other
party or its Credit  Support  Provider to make a payment under this Agreement or
any applicable  Credit Support Document without any deduction or withholding for
or on account of any Tax or with such deduction or withholding at a reduced rate
(so long as the  completion,  execution or  submission  of such form or document
would not materially  prejudice the legal or commercial position of the party in
receipt of such  demand),  with any such form or  document  to be  accurate  and
completed  in a manner  reasonably  satisfactory  to such other  party and to be
executed and to be delivered with any reasonably required certification,

in each case by the date specified in the Schedule or such  Confirmation  or, if
none is specified, as soon as reasonably practicable.

(b) Maintain  Authorisations.  It will use all reasonable efforts to maintain in
full force and effect all consents of any  governmental  or other authority that
are required to be obtained by it with  respect to this  Agreement or any Credit
Support  Document to which it is a party and will use all reasonable  efforts to
obtain any that may become necessary in the future.

(c Comply with Laws. It will comply in all material respects with all applicable
laws and  orders  to which it may be  subject  if  failure  so to  comply  would
materially impair its ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement or
any Credit Support Document to which it is a party.

(d) Tax Agreement.  It will give notice of any failure of a representation  made
by it under Section 3(f), to be accurate and true promptly upon learning of such
failure.

(e)  Payment  of Stamp Tax.  Subject  to  Section  11, it will pay any Stamp Tax
levied or imposed upon it or in respect of its execution or  performance of this
Agreement by a jurisdiction in which it is incorporated,  organised, managed and
controlled,  or  considered  to have its  seat,  or in which a branch  or office
through which it is acting for the purpose of this Agreement is located  ("Stamp
Tax  Jurisdiction")  and will  indemnify  the other party  against any Stamp Tax
levied  or  imposed  upon the other  party or in  respect  of the other  party's
execution or performance  of this  Agreement by any such Stamp Tax  Jurisdiction
which is not also a Stamp Tax Jurisdiction with respect to the other party.

5. Events or Default and Termination Events

(a) Events of Default. The occurrence at any time with respect to a party or, if
applicable, any Credit Support Provider of such party or any Specified Entity of
such party of any of the following  events  constitutes  an event of default (an
"Event of Default") with respect to such party:

(i)  Failure  to Pay or  Deliver.  Failure by the party to make,  when due,  any

(iii) Credit Support Default.

(1) Failure by the party or any Credit Support  Provider of such party to comply

(2) the expiration or termination of such Credit Support Document or the failing
or ceasing of such  Credit  Support  Document to be in full force and effect for
the purpose of this Agreement (in either case other than in accordance  with its
terms) prior to the  satisfaction  of all  obligations  of such party under each
Transaction to which such Credit Support  Document  relates  without the written
consent of the other party, or

(3) the party or such Credit Support Provider disaffirms,  disclaims, repudiates
or rejects,  in whole or in part,  or  challenges  the  validity of, such Credit

Credit  Support  Document  proves to have been  incorrect or  misleading  in any
material respect when made or repeated or deemed to have been made or repeated;

(v) Default under Specified Transaction.  The party, any Credit Support Provider
of such party or any  applicable  Specified  Entity of such  party (1)  defaults

obligations under, or an early termination of, that Specified  Transaction,  (2)
defaults,  after giving effect to any  applicable  notice  requirement  or grace
period,  in making any payment or delivery due on the last payment,  delivery or
exchange  date  of,  or  any  payment  on  early  termination  of,  a  Specified
Transaction (or such default continues for at least three Local Business Days if
there is no applicable  notice  requirement or grace period) or (3)  disaffirms,
disclaims,  repudiates or rejects, in whole or in part, a Specified  Transaction
(or such  action is taken by any  person or entity  appointed  or  empowered  to
operate it or act on its behalf);

(vi) Cross Default.  If "Cross Default" is specified in the Schedule as applying
to the party, the occurrence or existence of (1) a default,  event of default or
other similar  condition or event (however  described) in respect of such party,
any Credit Support Provider of such party or any applicable  Specified Entity of
such party under one or more  agreements  or  instruments  relating to Specified
Indebtedness  of any of them  (individually  or  collectively)  in an  aggregate
amount of not less than the  applicable  Threshold  Amount (as  specified in the
Schedule)  which  has  resulted  in such  Specified  Indebtedness  becoming,  or

agreements or  instruments,  before it would otherwise have been due and payable
or (2) a default by such party,  such Credit Support  Provider or such Specified
Entity  (individually or collectively) in making one or more payments on the due
date thereof in an aggregate  amount of not less than the  applicable  Threshold
Amount  under  such  agreements  or  instruments  (after  giving  effect  to any
applicable notice requirement or grace period);

of any such  proceeding  or petition  instituted  or presented  against it, such
proceeding  or petition (A) results in a judgment of insolvency or bankruptcy or

for all or substantially all its assets; (7) has a secured party take possession
of all or substantially all its assets or has a distress, execution, attachment,
sequestration or other legal process levied,  enforced or sued on or against all

case  within 30 days  thereafter;  (8)  causes or is  subject  to any event with
respect  to it which,  under the  applicable  laws of any  jurisdiction,  bas an
analogous  effect  to  any  of  the  events  specified  in  clauses  (1)  to (7)
(inclusive);  or (9)  takes any  action in  furtherance  of, or  indicating  its
consent to, approval of, or acquiescence in, any of the foregoing acts; or

(viii) Merger Without  Assumption.  The party or any Credit Support  Provider of
such  party  consolidates  or  amalgamates  with,  or  merges  with or into,  or
transfers all or  substantially  all its assets to,  another  entity and, at the
time of such consolidation, amalgamation, merger or transfer:-

(1) the  resulting,  surviving  or  transferee  entity  fails to assume  all the
obligations of such party or such Credit  Support  Provider under this Agreement
or any Credit  Support  Document to which it or its  predecessor  was a party by
operation  of law or pursuant to an  agreement  reasonably  satisfactory  to the
other party to this Agreement; or

(2) the  benefits of any Credit  Support  Document  fail to extend  (without the
consent of the other party) to the performance by such  resulting,  surviving or
transferee entity of its obligations under this Agreement.

(b) Termination  Events.  The occurrence at any time with respect to a party or,
if applicable, any Credit Support Provider of such party or any Specified Entity
of such party of any event  specified  below  constitutes  an  illegality if the
event is specified  in (i) below,  a Tax Event if the event is specified in (ii)
below or a Tax Event Upon Merger if the event is specified in (iii) below,  and,
if  specified  to be  applicable,  a Credit  Event  Upon  Merger if the event is
specified pursuant to (iv) below or an Additional Termination Event if the event
is specified pursuant to (v) below:-

(i)  Illegality.  Due to the adoption of, or any change in, any  applicable  law
after  the  date  on  which  a  Transaction  is  entered  into,  or  due  to the
promulgation of, or any change in, the interpretation by any court,  tribunal or
regulatory  authority  with competent  jurisdiction  of any applicable law after
such date, it becomes  unlawful (other than as a result of a breach by the party
of Section 4(b)) for such party (which will be the Affected Party):

(1) to  perform  any  absolute  or  contingent  obligation  to make a payment or
delivery or to receive a payment or delivery in respect of such  Transaction  or
to comply with any other material  provision of this Agreement  relating to such
Transaction; or

(2) to perform, or for any Credit Support Provider of such party to perform, any
contingent or other obligation which the party (or such Credit Support Provider)
has under my Credit Support Document relating to such Transaction;

(ii) Tax Event. Due to (x) any action taken by a taxing authority, or brought in
a court of competent  jurisdiction,  on or after the date on which a Transaction
is entered  into  (regardless  of whether  such action is taken or brought  with
respect  to a party to this  Agreement)  or (y) a Change  in Tax Law,  the party
(which will be the Affected  Party) will, or there is a  substantial  likelihood
that it will, on the next succeeding  Scheduled  Payment Date (1) be required to
pay to the other party an additional  amount in respect of an Indemnifiable  Tax
under  Section  2(d)(i)(4)  (except in respect of interest  under  Section 2(e),
6(d)(ii) or 6(e)) or (2)  receive a payment  from which an amount is required to
be  deducted  or  withheld  for or on  account  of a Tax  (except  in respect of
interest  under  Section  2(e),  6(d)(ii) or 6(e)) and no  additional  amount is
required to be paid in respect of such Tax under Section  2(d)(i)(4) (other than
by reason of Section 2(d)(i)(4)(A) or (B));

(iii) Tax Event  Upon  Merger.  The party  (the  "Burdened  Party")  on the next
succeeding  Scheduled  Payment  Date  will  either  (1)  be  required  to pay an
additional amount in respect of an Indemnifiable  Tax  under-Section  2(d)(i)(4)
(except in respect of  interest  under  Section  2(e),  6(d)(ii) or 6(e)) or (2)
receive a payment  from which an amount has been  deducted or withheld for or on
account of any  Indemnifiable  Tax in  respect  of which the other  party is not
required  to  pay  an  additional  amount  (other  than  by  reason  of  Section
2(d)(i)(4)(A)  or (B)), in either case as a result of a party  consolidating  or
amalgamating with, or merging with or into, or transferring all or substantially
all its assets to, another entity (which will be the Affected  Party) where such
action does not constitute an event described in Section 5(a)(viii);

(iv) Credit Event Upon Merger. If "Credit Event Upon Merger" is specified in the
Schedule as applying to the party, such party (-X-), any Credit Support Provider
of X or any applicable  Specified Entity of X consolidates or amalgamates  with,
or merges with or into,  or transfers  all or  substantially  all its assets to,
another entity and such action does not constitute an event described in Section
5(a)(viii) but the  creditworthiness  of the resulting,  surviving or transferee
entity is materially weaker than that of X, such Credit Support Provider or such
Specified Entity, as the case may be,  immediately prior to such action (and, in
such event,  X or its  successor  or  transferee,  as  appropriate,  will be the
Affected Party); or

(v) Additional  Termination  Event.  If any  "Additional  Termination  Event" is
specified in the Schedule or any  Confirmation  as applying,  the  occurrence of
such event (and, in such event,  the Affected Party or Affected Parties shall be
as  specified  for such  Additional  Termination  Event in the  Schedule or such
Confirmation).

(c) Event of Default and  Illegality.  If an event or  circumstance  which would
otherwise constitute or

give rise to an Event of Default  also  constitutes  an  Illegality,  it will be
created as an Illegality and will not constitute an Event of Default.

6. Early Termination

(a) Right to Terminate  Following  Event of Default.  If at any time an Event of
Default  with  respect to a party (the  "Defaulting  Party") has occurred and is
then continuing,  the other party (the "Non-defaulting  Party") may, by not more
than 20 days notice to the  Defaulting  Party  specifying  the relevant Event of
Default, designate a day not earlier than the day such notice is effective as in
Early Termination Date in respect of all outstanding Transactions.  If, however,
"Automatic  Early  Termination"  is  specified  in the Schedule as applying to a
party, then an Early Termination Date in respect of all outstanding Transactions
will occur  immediately  upon the  occurrence  with  respect to such party of an
Event of Default  specified in Section  5(a)(vii)(1),  (3),  (5), (6) or, to the
extent  analogous  thereto,  (8), and as of the time  immediately  preceding the
institution  of the  relevant  proceeding  or the  presentation  of the relevant
petition upon the  occurrence  with respect to such party of an Event of Default
specified in Section 5(a)(vii)(4) or, to the extent analogous thereto, (8).

(b) Right to Terminate Following Termination Event.

(i) Notice. If a Termination Event occurs, an Affected Party will, promptly upon
becoming  aware of it,  notify the other  party,  specifying  the nature of that
Termination  Event and each Affected  Transaction  and will also give such other
information  about  that  Termination  Event as the other  party may  reasonably
require.

(ii) Transfer to Avoid Termination  Event. If either an Illegality under Section
5(b)(i)(1) or a Tax Event occurs and there is only one Affected  Party,  or if a
Tax Event Upon Merger occurs and the Burdened Party is the Affected  Party,  the
Affected  Party  will,  as a  condition  to its  right  to  designate  in  Early
Termination Date under Section 6(b)(iv),  use all reasonable efforts (which will
not  require  such  party  to  incur a loss,  excluding  immaterial,  incidental
expenses) to transfer within 20 days after it gives notice under Section 6(b)(i)
all its rights and  obligations  under this Agreement in respect of the Affected
Transactions  to another of its Offices or Affiliates  so that such  Termination
Event ceases to exist.

If the Affected Party is not able to make such a transfer it will give notice to
the other party to that effect  within such 20 day period,  whereupon  the other
party may effect such a transfer  within 30 days after the notice is given under
Section 6(b)(i).

Any such transfer by a party under this Section  6(b)(ii) will be subject to and
conditional  upon the prior  written  consent of the other party,  which consent
will not be withheld if such other party's policies in effect at such time would
permit it to enter into transactions with the transferee on the terms proposed.

(iii) Two Affected Parties.  If an Illegality under Section 5(b)(i)(1)) or a Tax
Event  occurs  and there  are two  Affected  Parties,  each  party  will use all
reasonable  efforts to reach  agreement  within 30 days after notice  thereof is
given under Section 6(b)(i) on action to avoid that Termination Event.

(iv) Right to Terminate. If:-

(1) a transfer under Section  6(b)(ii) or an agreement under Section  6(b)(iii),
as the  case  may  be,  has not  been  effected  with  respect  to all  Affected
Transactions  within 30 days after an Affected  Party gives notice under Section
6(b)(i); or

(2) an  Illegality  under Section  5(b)(i)(2),  a Credit Event Upon Merger or an
Additional  Termination  Event occurs, or a Tax Event Upon Merger occurs and the
Burdened Party is not the Affected Party,

either party in the case of an  Illegality,  the Burdened Party in the case of a
Tax  Event  Upon  Merger,  any  Affected  Party in the case of a Tax Event or an
Additional  Termination  Event if there is more than one Affected  Party, or the
party which is not the Affected  Party in the case of a Credit Event Upon Merger
or an Additional  Termination  Event if there is only one Affected Party may, by
not more than 20 days notice to the other party and  provided  that the relevant
Termination  Event is then continuing,  designate a day not earlier than the day
such notice is effective as an Early Termination Date in respect of all Affected
Transactions.

(c) Effect of Designation.

(i) If notice  designating an Early Termination Date is given under Section 6(a)
or (b), the Early Termination Date will occur on the date so designated, whether
or not the relevant Event of Default or Termination Event is then continuing.

(ii) Upon the occurrence or effective  designation of an Early Termination Date,
no further  payments or deliveries  under Section  2(a)(i) or 2(e) in respect of
the Terminated  Transactions  will be required to be made, but without prejudice
to the other  provisions  of this  Agreement.  The  amount,  if any,  payable in
respect of an Early  Termination  Date shall be  determined  pursuant to Section
6(e).

(d) Calculations.

(i) Statement.  On or as soon as reasonably practicable following the occurrence
of an Early Termination Date, each party will make the calculations on its part,
if any,  contemplated  by Section  6(e) and will  provide  to the other  party a
statement (1) showing,  in reasonable detail,  such calculations  (including all
relevant  quotations  and  specifying any amount payable under Section 6(e)) and
(2) giving details of the relevant  account to which any amount payable to it is
to be  paid.  In the  absence  of  written  confirmation  from the  source  of a
quotation  obtained in determining a Market Quotation,  the records of the party
obtaining  such  quotation  will be  conclusive  evidence of the  existence  and
accuracy of such quotation.

(ii) Payment  Date.  An amount  calculated  as being due in respect of any Early
Termination  Date under  Section  6(e) will be payable on the day that notice of
the amount payable is effective (in the case of an Early  Termination Date which
is designated or occurs as a result of an Event of Default) and on the day which
is two Local  Business Days after the day on which notice of the amount  payable
is effective (in the case of an Early  Termination Date which is designated as a
result of a Termination  Event).  Such amount will be paid together with (to the
extent permitted under applicable law) interest thereon (before as well as after
judgment) in the Termination  Currency,  from (and including) the relevant Early
Termination  Date to (but  excluding)  the date  such  amount  is  paid,  at the
Applicable  Rate.  Such  interest  will be  calculated  on the  basis  of  daily
compounding and the actual number of days elapsed.

(e) Payments on Early  Termination.  If an Early  Termination  Date occurs,  the
following  provisions shall apply based on the parties' election in the Schedule
of a payment measure, either "Market Quotation" or "Loss", and a payment method,
either the  "First  Method-  or the  "Second  Method".  If the  parties  fail to
designate a payment measure or payment method in the Schedule. it will be deemed
that "Market Quotation" or the "Second Method", as the case may be, shall apply.
The  amount,  if any,  payable  in  respect  of an  Early  Termination  Date and
determined pursuant to this Section will be subject to any Set-off.

(i) Events of Default.  If the Early  Termination  Date results from an Event of
Default:

(1) First Method and Market Quotation.  If the First Method and Market Quotation
apply, the Defaulting Party will pay to the Non-defaulting  Party the excess, if
a positive number,  of (A) the sum of the Settlement  Amount  (determined by the
Non-defaulting  Party)  in  respect  of  the  Terminated  Transactions  and  the
Termination   Currency   Equivalent   of  the  Unpaid   Amounts   owing  to  the
Non-defaulting  Party over (B) the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid
Amounts owing to the Defaulting Party.

(2) First Method and Loss.  If the First Method and Loss apply,  the  Defaulting
Party  will  pay  to  the  Non-defaulting  Party,  if  a  positive  number,  the
Non-defaulting Party's Loss in respect of this Agreement.

(3)  Second  Method  and  Market  Quotation.  If the  Second  Method  and Market
Quotation  apply,  an  amount  will  be  payable  equal  to (A)  the  sum of the
Settlement  Amount  (determined by the  Non-defaulting  Party) in respect of the
Terminated  Transactions and the Termination  Currency  Equivalent of the Unpaid
Amounts  owing to the  Non-defaulting  Party less (B) the  Termination  Currency
Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to the Defaulting  Party.  If that amount
is a positive  number,  the Defaulting  Party will pay it to the  Non-defaulting
Party;  if it is a  negative  number,  the  Non-defaulting  Party  will  pay the
absolute value of that amount to the Defaulting Party.

(4) Second Method and Loss. If the Second Method and Loss apply,  an amount will
be  payable  equal  to the  Non-defaulting  Party's  Loss  in  respect  of  this
Agreement. If that amount is a positive number, the Defaulting Party will pay it
to the  Non-defaulting  Party; if it is a negative  number,  the  Non-defaulting
Party will pay the absolute value of that amount to the Defaulting Party.

(ii) Termination Events. If the Early Termination Date results from a
Termination Event:

(1) One Affected Party. If there is one Affected Party,  the amount payable will
be  determined  in  accordance  with  Section  6(e)(i)(3),  if Market  Quotation
applies,  or Section 6(e)(i)(4),  if Loss applies,  except that, in either case,
references  to the  Defaulting  Party and to the  Non-defaulting  Party  will be
deemed to be  references  to the  Affected  Party and the party which is not the
Affected  Party,  respectively,  and,  if Loss  applies  and fewer  than all the
Transactions  are being  terminated,  Loss shall be calculated in respect of all
Terminated Transactions.

(2) Two Affected Parties. If there are two Affected Parties:

(A) if Market Quotation  applies,  each party will determine a Settlement Amount
in respect of the Terminated  Transactions,  and an amount will be payable equal
to (1) the sum of (a) one-half of the difference  between the Settlement  Amount
of the party with the higher  Settlement  Amount ("X") and the Settlement Amount
of the party  with the lower  Settlement  Amount  ("Y") and (b) the  Termination
Currency  Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to X less (11) the  Termination
Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to Y; and

(B) if Loss  applies,  each  party  will  determine  its Loss in respect of this
Agreement  (or,  if fewer than all the  Transactions  are being  terminated,  in
respect of all Terminated  Transactions)  and an amount will be payable equal to
one-half  of the  difference  between the Loss of the party with the higher Loss
("X") and the Loss of the party with the lower Loss ("Y").

If the  amount  payable  is a  positive  number,  Y will pay it to X; if it is a
negative number, X will pay the absolute value of that amount to Y.

(iii)  Adjustment for Bankruptcy.  In circumstances  where an Early  Termination
Date occurs because "Automatic Early Termination" applies in respect of a party,
the  amount  determined  under  this  Section  6(e)  will  be  subject  to  such
adjustments as are  appropriate  and permitted by law to reflect any payments or
deliveries  made by one party to the other under this Agreement (and retained by
such other party) during the period from the relevant Early  Termination Date to
the date for payment determined under Section 6(d)(ii).

(iv) Pre-Estimate.  The parties agree that if Market Quotation applies an amount
recoverable under this Section 6(e) is a reasonable pre-estimate of loss and not
a  penalty.  Such  amount is  payable  for the loss of  bargain  and the loss of
protection  against  future  risks and  except  as  otherwise  provided  in this
Agreement neither party will be entitled to recover any additional  damages as a
consequence of such losses.

7. Transfer

Subject  to  Section  6(b)(ii),  neither  this  Agreement  nor any  interest  or
obligation  in or under this  Agreement  may be  transferred  (whether by way of
security or otherwise) by either party without the prior written  consent of the
other party, except that:-

(a)  a  party  may  make  such  a  transfer  of  this  Agreement  pursuant  to a
consolidation  or amalgamation  with, or merger with or into, or transfer of all
or substantially all its assets to, another entity (but without prejudice to any
other right or remedy under this Agreement); and

(b) a party may make such a transfer  of all or any part of its  interest in any
amount payable to it from a Defaulting Party under Section 6(e).

Any purported transfer that is not in compliance with this Section will be void.

8.    Contractual Currency

(a) Payment in the Contractual Currency.  Each payment under this Agreement will
be made in the relevant  currency  specified in this  Agreement for that payment
(the  "Contractual  Currency").  To the extent  permitted by applicable law, any
obligation to make payments  under this  Agreement in the  Contractual  Currency
will not be discharged or satisfied by any tender in any currency other than the
Contractual  Currency,  except to the extent such  tender  results in the actual
receipt by the party to which payment is owed, acting in a reasonable manner and
in good faith in  converting  the  currency  so  tendered  into the  Contractual
Currency,  of the full amount in the Contractual Currency of all amounts payable
in respect of this  Agreement.  If for any reason the amount in the  Contractual
Currency  so  received  falls  short of the amount in the  Contractual  Currency
payable in respect of this  Agreement,  the party  required  to make the payment
will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, immediately pay such additional
amount in the  Contractual  Currency as may be necessary to  compensate  for the
shortfall.  If for any reason the amount in the Contractual Currency so received
exceeds  the  amount in the  Contractual  Currency  payable  in  respect of this
Agreement,  the party  receiving the payment will refund  promptly the amount of
such excess.

(b)  Judgments.  To the extent  permitted by applicable  law, if any judgment or
order  expressed in a currency other than the  Contractual  Currency is rendered
(i) for the payment of any amount owing in respect of this  Agreement,  (ii) for
the payment of any amount  relating to any early  termination in respect of this
Agreement  or (iii) in respect of a judgmcnt  or order of another  court for the
payment  of any  amount  described  in (i) or  (ii)  above,  the  party  seeking
recovery,  after recovery in full of the aggregate amount to which such party is
entitled  pursuant  to the  judgment  or  order,  will be  entitled  to  receive
immediately  from the other party the amount of any shortfall of the Contractual
Currency  received  by such  party as a  consequence  of sums paid in such other
currency  and  will  refund  promptly  to the  other  party  any  excess  of the
Contractual  Currency  received by such party as a  consequence  of sums paid in
such other  currency if such shortfall or such excess arises or results from any
variation  between  the rate of exchange  at which the  Contractual  Currency is
converted  into the  currency of the  judgment or order for the purposes of such
judgment or order and the rate of  exchange at which such party is able,  acting
in a reasonable  manner and in good faith in  converting  the currency  received
into the Contractual  Currency,  to purchase the  Contractual  Currency with the
amount of the currency of the judgment or order actually received by such party.
The term "rate of exchange" includes, without limitation, any premiums and costs
of exchange  payable in connection  with the purchase of or conversion  into the
Contractual Currency.

(c) Separate  Indemnities.  To the extent  permitted by  applicable  law,  these
indemnities  constitute  separate  and  independent  obligations  from the other
obligations in this  Agreement,  will be enforceable as separate and independent
causes of action, will apply notwithstanding any indulgence granted by the party
to which any payment is owed and will not be affected by judgment being obtained
or claim or proof  being  made for any other  sums  payable  in  respect or this
Agreement.

(d) Evidence of Loss.  For the purpose of this Section 8, it will be  sufficient
for a party to  demonstrate  that it would  have  suffered  a loss had an actual
exchange or purchase been made.

Transaction  from the  moment  they  agree to those  terms  (whether  orally  or
otherwise).  A Confirmation shall be entered into as soon as practicable and may

or jurisdiction of  incorporation or organisation of such party, the obligations
of such party are the same as if it had entered into the Transaction through its
head or home office.  This  representation will be deemed to be repeated by such
party on each date on which a Transaction is entered into.

(b)  Neither  party may change the Office  through  which it makes and  receives
payments  or  deliveries  for the  purpose of a  Transaction  without  the prior
written consent of the other party.

which it makes and receives payments or deliveries with respect to a Transaction
will be specified in the relevant Confirmation.

Proceedings  in  any  one  or  more  jurisdictions   preclude  the  bringing  of
Proceedings in any other jurisdiction.

reference  to  quotations  of relevant  rates or prices from one or more leading
dealers in the relevant markets.

"Market  Quotation" means,  with respect to one or more Terminated  Transactions
and a party  making  the  determination,  an amount  determined  on the basis of
quotations from Reference  Market-makers.  Each quotation will be for an amount,

Market-maker to enter into a transaction (the  "Replacement  Transaction")  that
would have the effect of  preserving  for such party the economic  equivalent of
any payment or delivery  (whether  the  underlying  obligation  was  absolute or
contingent and assuming the satisfaction of each applicable condition precedent)
by the parties under Section 2(a)(i) in respect of such  Terminated  Transaction
or group of Terminated  Transactions  that would,  but for the occurrence of the
relevant Early  Termination  Date,  have been required after that date. For this
purpose,  Unpaid  Amounts in respect of the  Terminated  Transaction or group of
Terminated Transactions are to be excluded but, without limitation,  any payment
or delivery that would, but for the relevant Early  Termination  Date, have been
required (assuming  satisfaction of each applicable  condition  precedent) after
that Early Termination Date is to be included. The Replacement Transaction would
be subject to such  documentation  as such party and the Reference  Market-maker
may, in good faith,  agree.  The party making the  determination  (or its agent)
will request each Reference  Market-maker to provide its quotation to the extent
reasonably  practicable as of the same day and time (without regard to different
time zones) on or as soon as  reasonably  practicable  after the relevant  Early
Termination  Date.  The day and  time as of  which  those  quotations  are to be
obtained  will  be  selected  in  good  faith  by the  party  obliged  to make a
determination  under  Section  6(c),  and,  if each party is so  obliged,  after
consultation  with the other.  If more than three  quotations are provided,  the
Market  Quotation will be the arithmetic mean of the quotations,  without regard
to the quotations  having the highest and lowest  values.  If exactly three such
quotations are provided,  the Market  Quotation will be the quotation  remaining
after disregarding the highest and lowest quotations.  For this purpose, if more
than one quotation has the same highest value or lowest value,  then one of such
quotations shall be disregarded. If fewer than three quotations are provided, it
will be  deemed  that  the  Market  Quotation  in  respect  of  such  Terminated
Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions cannot be determined.

"Non-default  Rate" means a rate per annum equal to the cost  (without  proof or
evidence of any actual cost) to the Non-defaulting Party (as certified by it) if
it were to fund the relevant amount.

an  extension  of credit  and (b) to the  extent  practicable,  from  among such
dealers having an office in the same city.

"Relevant Jurisdiction" means, with respect to a party, the jurisdictions (a) in

on, such payer.

"Settlement  Amount"  means,  with respect to a party and any Early  Termination
Date, the sum of:-

(a) the  Termination  Currency  Equivalent  of the  Market  Quotations  (whether

Transactions for which a Market Quotation is determined; and

(b) such party's Loss (whether positive or negative and without reference to any
Unpaid  Amounts)  for  each  Terminated   Transaction  or  group  or  Terminated
Transactions  for which a Market Quotation cannot be determined or would not (in
the  reasonable  belief  of  the  party  making  the  determination)  produce  a
commercially reasonable result.

(b)  Set-Off.  Section 6 of this  Agreement  is  hereby  amended  by adding  the
following subsection (f) at the end thereof:

(f)  Set-off.  Any  amount  (the  "Early  Termination  Amount")  payable  by the
Non-Defaulting Party to the Defaulting Party under Section (e), as a consequence
of the occurrence of an event set forth in Section 5(a)(vii), may, at the option
of the Non-Defaulting  Party (and without prior notice to the Defaulting Party),
be reduced by its set-off against any amount(s) (the "Other  Agreement  Amount")
payable  (whether  at such  time or in the  future or upon the  occurrence  of a
contingency) by the Defaulting Party to the Non-Defaulting  Party  (irrespective
of the currency,  place of payment or booking  office of the  obligation)  under
this agreement or any other  agreement(s)  between the Defaulting  Party and the
Non-Defaulting  Party or instrument(s) or  undertaking(s)  issued or executed by
one party to, or in favor of, the other  party (and the Other  Agreement  Amount
will be discharged promptly and in all respects to the extent it is so set-off).
The Non-Defaulting Party will give notice to the Defaulting Party of any set-off
effected under this Section 6(f).

For this purpose,  either the Early  Termination  Amount or the Other  Agreement
Amount  (or the  relevant  portion  of such  amounts)  may be  converted  by the
Non-Defaulting  Party into the currency in which the other is denominated at the
rate of exchange at which the  Non-Defaulting  Party would be able,  acting in a
reasonable  manner and in good faith,  to purchase the  relevant  amount of such
currency.

Nothing  in this  Section  6(f) shall be  effective  to create a charge or other
security interest.  This Section 6(f) shall be without prejudice and in addition
to any right of set-off,  combination of accounts,  lien or other right to which
any  party is at any time  otherwise  entitled  (whether  by  operation  of law,
contract or otherwise).

(c)  Severability.  If any  term,  provision,  covenant,  or  condition  of this
Agreement,  or the application  thereof to any party or  circumstance,  shall be
held to be invalid or  unenforceable  (in whole or in part) for any reason,  the
remaining terms,  provision  covenants,  and conditions hereof shall continue in
full force and effect as if this Agreement had been executed with the invalid or
unenforceable portion eliminated.  The parties shall endeavor, in good faith, to
replace the invalid,  illegal or unenforceable  provisions with valid provisions
the economic  effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the invalid,
illegal or unenforceable provision.

(d) Consent to  Recording.  Each party hereby agrees that the other party or its
agents may electronically record all telephone conversations between officers or
employees  of the  consenting  party and the  officers or employees of the other
party who quote transactions on behalf of the party. Any such recordings will be
used only in  connection  with any  misunderstanding  or question  arising  with
respect to any  transaction  discussed over the telephone by or on behalf of the
parties;  it being understood that no such recordings shall constitute  evidence
of a  Transaction  unless  all  material  terms of such  Transaction  have  been
expressly  agreed to by the  parties.  Each party  further  agrees to notify its
officers or employees that telephone  conversations  with such persons acting on
behalf of the other party may be recorded.

(e) Additional Representations, Each Party represents to the other (which
representations shall be deemed to be repeated by each party on each date on
which a Transaction is entered into) that:

principal and not as an agent for any third party.

Amount to the extent that a Delivery Amount would not be created or increased by
that Transfer, as calculated by the Valuation Agent (and the date of calculation
will be deemed to be a Valuation Date for this purpose).  The Interest Amount or
portion  thereof not  Transferred  pursuant to this  Paragraph  will  constitute
Posted  Collateral  in the  form of Cash  and will be  subject  to the  security
interest granted under Paragraph 2.

                      CENTRAL SERVICING OF QUALIFIED LOANS

      Section 3.01.  Central Servicer  to Act as Servicer.

     (a) Commencing  with each Closing Date, the Central  Servicer shall service
the Qualified Loans  (including REO Qualified  Loans)  identified in the related
Schedule of Qualified Loans in conformity with this Agreement and the Securities
Guide as it  applies  to the  Qualified  Loans  and shall  have  full  power and
authority,  acting alone and/or  through field  servicers as provided in Section
3.15,  to do any and all things  which it may deem  necessary  or  desirable  in
connection with such servicing.

     (b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,  the Central Servicer
is hereby  authorized  and  empowered  by Farmer Mac when the  Central  Servicer
believes it appropriate,  in its best judgment,  but consistent with and subject
to the terms of this Agreement, to execute and deliver, on behalf of Farmer Mac,
any and all instruments of satisfaction or  cancellation,  or of partial or full
release or discharge and all other comparable  instruments,  with respect to the
Qualified Loans and with respect to the Mortgaged  Properties.  Farmer Mac shall
cause the Central Servicer to be furnished from time to time with such Powers of
Attorney  and other  documents  necessary or  appropriate  to enable the Central
Servicer to service and administer  the Qualified  Loans upon the request of the
Central Servicer. The Central Servicer shall provide Farmer Mac with the form of
any such  Power(s) of Attorney or other  document(s)  (reasonably  acceptable to
Farmer  Mac) and Farmer Mac agrees to cause such  Power(s)  of Attorney or other
documents to be executed and returned  promptly after hard copy receipt  thereof
by Farmer Mac. Farmer Mac acknowledges and understands that the Central Servicer
may submit  Power(s) of Attorney to Farmer Mac on an annual basis for  recording
each year in accordance  with local law  requirements,  and Farmer Mac agrees to
cause such  Power(s) of Attorney to be executed  and returned as provided in the
preceding sentence.

     Section 3.02.  Collection of Certain  Qualified Loan  Payments;  Collection
Account.



     (a) The Central Servicer shall,  consistent with this Agreement and, to the
extent not inconsistent  with the Securities Guide, in accordance with customary
industry  standards for  agricultural  mortgage loan servicing,  make reasonable
efforts to collect all payments called for under the terms and provisions of the
Qualified  Loans. The Central  Servicer may in its discretion  waive,  postpone,
reschedule, modify or otherwise compromise the terms of payment of any Qualified
Loan so long as any such waiver,  postponement,  rescheduling,  modification  or
compromise shall not be inconsistent with this Agreement,  or be consented to in
advance in writing by Farmer Mac. No such arrangement  shall alter or modify the
amortization  schedule of such Qualified  Loan for purposes of  calculating  any
Central  Servicer  Advance  Requirement  in respect  thereof  without  the prior
written  consent of Farmer Mac. In  addition,  the Central  Servicer  may in its
discretion permit the substitution of an Eligible Substitute  Mortgaged Property
for an Existing  Mortgaged Property so long as the Mortgage Note relating to the
Qualified  Loan that the  Existing  Mortgaged  Property  secures  is a  Recourse
Obligation.  The Central Servicer may waive, in whole or in part, the obligation
of a Borrower  to pay a Yield  Maintenance  Amount  only with the prior  written
consent of Farmer Mac.

     (b) The Central Servicer shall establish and maintain a Collection  Account
in its name for the  benefit of Farmer Mac (and for which  Farmer Mac shall bear
any costs and  expenses  incurred  with respect to  withdrawals  with respect to
Remittance  Date) in which the  Central  Servicer  shall  deposit as promptly as
practicable  following  receipt (but in no event later than one (1) Business Day
following  receipt)  except as otherwise  specifically  provided  herein or in a
Central Servicing Supplement, the following payments and collections received by
it  subsequent  to the  Cut-Off  Date (other  than in respect of  principal  and
interest on the Qualified Loans due on or before the Cut-Off Date):

          (i) All payments on account of principal on the Qualified Loans;

          (ii) All  payments  on  account of  interest  on the  Qualified  Loans
     adjusted,  in each case, to interest at the  applicable  Net Mortgage Rate,
     except that the portion of any such payment on account of interest accruing
     on any  delinquent  Installment  Payment  with  respect  to which a Central
     Servicer  Advance is  outstanding  need not be deposited in the  Collection
     Account;

          (iii)  Net  Liquidation  Proceeds,  Net  REO  Proceeds  and  Insurance
     Proceeds (other than Insurance Proceeds to be applied to the restoration or
     repair of the related  Mortgaged  Property  or released to the  Borrower in
     accordance with the Central Servicer's normal servicing  procedures) net of
     any amounts  permitted to be withheld by the Central  Servicer as servicing
     compensation  pursuant  to  Section  3.09  or  permitted  to be paid to the
     Central  Servicer  pursuant to the last sentence of Section 3.07(e) and not
     paid directly by Farmer Mac;

          (iv) All  proceeds of any  Qualified  Loans  purchased  by the Central
     Servicer or repurchased by the seller of such Qualified Loan;

          (v) All Yield Maintenance Amounts paid by Borrowers;

          (vi) Any deposit  required by the second paragraph of Section 3.05(a);
     and

          (vii) Any late charge or interest on the Qualified Loans accruing at a
     default rate related to  delinquent  Installment  Payments  with respect to
     which no Central Servicer Advance was made.

     Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  the Central Servicer shall not be required
to deposit  and may retain late  collections,  including  Liquidation  Proceeds,
Insurance  Proceeds  and REO Proceeds to the extent of unpaid  Central  Servicer
Advances and servicing advances with respect to the related Qualified Loans. The
foregoing requirements for deposit in the Collection Account shall be exclusive,
it being  understood  and agreed that,  without  limiting the  generality of the
foregoing,  payments  or  collections  in the  nature of late  payment  charges,
assumption  fees or other service  charges  imposed upon Borrowers in connection
with servicing the Qualified  Loans may but need not be deposited by the Central
Servicer in the  Collection  Account.  In the event the Central  Servicer  shall
deposit  in the  Collection  Account  any amount not  required  to be  deposited
therein,  it may at any time withdraw such amount from the  Collection  Account,
any provision herein to the contrary notwithstanding.

     (c) The  Central  Servicer  shall  cause  the  institution  with  which the
Collection  Account is maintained to invest the funds in the Collection  Account
attributable to the Qualified Loans in those Permitted  Investments specified in
writing by Farmer Mac which  shall  mature in  immediately  available  funds not
later than the day preceding the next  Remittance  Date and shall not be sold or
disposed of prior to maturity.  All earnings  and gains  realized  from any such
investments  in the  Collection  Account shall be for the benefit of Farmer Mac.
The amount of any losses or expenses  incurred in connection with the investment
of amounts in the  Collection  Account  shall be deducted  from the amount to be
distributed to Farmer Mac.

     (d) The Central Servicer shall give notice to Farmer Mac of the location of
the Collection Account, and of any change in the location thereof,  prior to the
use thereof.

     Section 3.03.  Payment of Taxes,  Assessments and Other Items;  Advances by
Central Servicer.

     (a) The Central  Servicer shall use its best efforts to cause the Borrowers
to pay any taxes,  assessments,  Standard Hazard Insurance  Policy premiums,  or
other charges with respect to which the failure to pay would result in a lien on
the related Mortgaged  Property by operation of law or comparable items relating
to the Mortgaged Properties.

     (b)  The  Central  Servicer  shall  advance  the  payments  referred  to in
subsection  (a) that are not timely paid by the  Borrowers  on the date when the
tax,  premium or other cost for which such  payment is intended is due,  but the
Central  Servicer  shall  be  required  so to  advance  only  (x) to the  extent
necessary, in the good faith judgment of the Central Servicer, to protect Farmer
Mac  against  any  loss  and (y) so long as in the good  faith  judgment  of the
Central  Servicer,  such advances  ultimately would be recoverable from payments
(other than  Installment  Payments)  made by the  Borrower  or from  Liquidation
Proceeds.

     Section  3.04.   Permitted   Withdrawals   from  the  Collection   Account;
Maintenance of Accounting Records.

     (a) The Central  Servicer may, from time to time as provided  herein,  make
withdrawals from the Collection Account for the following purposes:

          (i) to make distributions to Farmer Mac on each Remittance Date;

          (ii) at any time to withdraw any amount  deposited  in the  Collection
     Account that was not required to be deposited  therein  pursuant to Section
     3.02(b);

          (iii) to reimburse itself for previously unreimbursed Central Servicer
     Advances and servicing  advances,  the Central Servicer's right to withdraw
     amounts  pursuant to this clause (iii) being limited to amounts received on
     particular Qualified Loans (including, for this purpose, Borrower payments,
     Insurance Proceeds,  Liquidation  Proceeds,  REO Proceeds and proceeds from
     the  repurchase  of  the  related  Qualified  Loan)  which  represent  late
     recoveries  of  Installment  Payments  respecting  which  any such  Central
     Servicer Advance was made; and

          (iv) to reimburse itself for any Nonrecoverable  Advance and to pay to
     an  Independent  contractor  any fee to be paid or reimbursed by Farmer Mac
     pursuant to the last sentence of Section 3.07(e).

     (b) The Central  Servicer  shall keep and  maintain or cause to be kept and
maintained separate accounting, on a Qualified Loan-by-Qualified Loan basis, for
the  purpose  of  providing  Farmer  Mac or its  designee  with the  information
necessary for the preparation of such reports as may be requested by Farmer Mac.

     Section 3.05.  Maintenance of Hazard Insurance and Errors and Omissions and
Fidelity Coverage.


     (a) The Central  Servicer  shall cause to be maintained  for each Qualified
Loan a Standard Hazard  Insurance  Policy insuring against loss or damage to the
insurable  improvements  included in the  Appraised  Value in an amount not less
than the value  assigned  to such  improvements  in the related  appraisal.  The
Central  Servicer  shall also cause to be maintained  on property  acquired upon
foreclosure,  or deed in lieu of foreclosure,  of any Qualified Loan, a Standard
Hazard  Insurance  Policy in an amount at least equal to the amount necessary to
avoid the application of any co-insurance clause contained in the related hazard
insurance policy. Pursuant to Section 3.02, any amounts collected by the Central
Servicer  under any such  policies  (other  than  amounts  to be  applied to the
restoration  or  repair of the  related  Mortgaged  Property  or  property  thus
acquired or amounts  released to the  Borrower  in  accordance  with the Central
Servicer's  normal  servicing  procedures)  shall be deposited in the Collection
Account,  subject to withdrawal  pursuant to Section 3.04.  Any cost incurred by
the Central  Servicer  in  maintaining  any such  insurance  shall not,  for the
purpose of  calculating  amounts  required  to be  deposited  in the  Collection
Account, be added to the amount owing under the Qualified Loan,  notwithstanding
that the terms of the Qualified Loan so permit. Such costs shall be reimbursable
to the Central Servicer in accordance with Section 3.04(a)(iii) as if such costs
were contained in a Central Servicer  Advance.  It is understood and agreed that
no earthquake or other additional insurance is to be required of any Borrower or
maintained  on  property  acquired  in  respect of a  Qualified  Loan other than
pursuant to such laws and  regulations  applicable  to such Borrower as shall at
any time be in force and as shall require such additional insurance.

     If the  Central  Servicer  shall  maintain  a blanket  policy  issued by an
insurer having a Moody's financial  strength rating of A3 or higher and insuring
against hazard losses on all of the Qualified  Loans,  it shall  conclusively be
deemed to have  satisfied its  obligation as set forth in this Section  3.05(a).
Such policy may contain a deductible  clause,  in which case, if there shall not
have been maintained on the related  Mortgaged  Property or acquired property an
insurance  policy  complying with the first  sentence of the first  paragraph of
this  Section  3.05(a),  and there  shall  have been a loss that would have been
covered by such a policy had it been  maintained,  the Central Servicer shall be
required to deposit  from its own funds into the  Collection  Account the amount
not  otherwise  payable  under the  blanket  policy  because of such  deductible
clause.

     (b)  The  Central   Servicer   shall   obtain  and   maintain  at  its  own
(non-reimbursable) expense and keep in full force and effect throughout the term
of this Agreement a blanket fidelity bond and an errors and omissions  insurance
policy (which errors and omissions  insurance  policy shall provide  coverage in
accordance with the Securities Guide) covering the Central  Servicer's  officers
and  employees  and other  persons  acting on behalf of the Central  Servicer in
connection with its activities  under this Agreement,  except that such policies
need not specifically insure against the acts of Field Servicers,  except to the
extent the Field Servicer is receiving payments on Qualified Loans, or executing
documents  under a power of  attorney  granted by the Central  Servicer.  In the
event that any such required bond or policy ceases to be in effect,  the Central
Servicer shall obtain a comparable  replacement bond or policy from an issuer or
insurer,  as the case may be,  providing  such  coverage  as shall  satisfy  the
requirements set forth in the Securities Guide. Coverage of the Central Servicer
under a policy or bond  obtained by an  Affiliate  of the Central  Servicer  and
providing  the  coverage  required by this  Section  3.05(b)  shall  satisfy the
requirements of this Section 3.05(b).

     Section 3.06. Enforcement of Due-on-Sale Clauses; Assumption Agreements.

     (a) When any Mortgaged  Property is conveyed by the  Borrower,  the Central
Servicer  may,  but  shall  not be  required  to,  enforce  any  due-on-sale  or
due-on-encumbrance  clause  contained  in any  Mortgage  Note  or  Mortgage,  in
accordance with the provisions of such Mortgage Note or Mortgage and in the best
interests of Farmer Mac, and may approve the  assumption of the Mortgage Note by
the transferee of the Mortgaged Property;  provided,  however, that after giving
due effect to any such additional  encumbrance,  the loan-to-value  ratio of the
related Qualified Loan is not in excess of the Loan-to-Value Ratio thereof as of
the Cut-Off Date.

     (b) In any case in which a Mortgaged Property is to be conveyed to a Person
by a  Borrower,  and such  Person is to enter into an  assumption  agreement  or
substitution  agreement or  supplement  to the Mortgage  Note or Mortgage  which
requires  the  signature  of Farmer  Mac, or if an  instrument  of release to be
signed by Farmer Mac is required  releasing the Borrower  from  liability on the
Qualified  Loan, the Central  Servicer shall deliver or cause to be delivered to
Farmer Mac (or its designee) for signature  the  assumption  agreement  with the
Person to whom the  Mortgaged  Property is to be conveyed and such  substitution
agreement or supplement to the Mortgage Note or Mortgage or other instruments as
are  reasonable  or  necessary  to carry out the terms of the  Mortgage  Note or
Mortgage or otherwise to comply with any applicable  laws regarding  assumptions
or the transfer of the Mortgaged  Property to such Person.  The Central Servicer
shall also  deliver or cause to be  delivered  to Farmer Mac with the  foregoing
documents a letter  explaining  the nature of such  documents  and the reason or
reasons why Farmer Mac's  signature is required.  With such letter,  the Central
Servicer  shall  deliver to Farmer Mac a certificate  of a Servicing  Officer in
form  reasonably  satisfactory  to Farmer Mac  certifying  that: (i) a Servicing
Officer has examined and approved such documents as to form and substance,  (ii)
Farmer Mac's  execution  and delivery  thereof will not conflict with or violate
any terms of this Agreement;  (iii) subsequent to the closing of the transaction
involving the  assumption or transfer (A) the Qualified Loan will continue to be
secured by a first  mortgage  lien pursuant to the terms of the Mortgage and (B)
no material term  (including,  but not limited to, the Mortgage Rate, the amount
of any  Installment  Payment  and any term  affecting  the  amount  or timing of
payment) of the  Qualified  Loan will be altered  and the term of the  Qualified
Loan will not be increased  and (iv) if the  seller/transferor  of the Mortgaged
Property is to be released  from  liability on the Qualified  Loan,  the Central
Servicer has  evaluated the  creditworthiness  of the  buyer/transferee  and has
determined  that if the  buyer/transferee  were applying for the Qualified  Loan
being  assumed,  such loan would be a Qualified  Loan, and such release will not
adversely affect the  collectibility of the Qualified Loan (based on the Central
Servicer's good faith determination).  Upon receipt of and in reliance upon such
certificate,   Farmer  Mac  (or  its  designee)   shall  execute  any  necessary
instruments for such  assumption or substitution of liability.  Upon the closing
of the transactions  contemplated by such documents,  the Central Servicer shall
cause the originals of the  assumption  agreement,  the release (if any), or the
modification  or  supplement to the Mortgage Note or Mortgage to be delivered to
Farmer Mac.

     (c) The Central  Servicer  shall be  entitled  to approve a request  from a
Borrower  for the granting of an easement on the related  Mortgaged  Property in
favor of another Person,  any alteration or demolition of the related  Mortgaged
Property or other similar matters if (A) it has determined,  exercising its good
faith  business  judgment in the same manner as it would if it were the owner of
the related  Qualified Loan, that (i) the security for such Qualified Loan would
not  be  materially  adversely  affected  thereby;  (ii)  the  timely  and  full
collectibility  of such Qualified Loan would not be adversely  affected thereby;
and (iii) as a result of such easement, alteration,  demolition or other similar
matter,  the  loan-to-value  ratio  would not be in excess of the  Loan-to-Value
Ratio with respect to such  Qualified  Loan as of the Cut-Off  Date;  and (B) it
follows the requirements and procedures  therefor as set forth in the Securities
Guide, if applicable.

      Section 3.07.           Realization Upon Defaulted Qualified Loans.

     (a) (i)  Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary in this  Agreement,  the
     Central  Servicer  shall not,  on behalf of Farmer Mac,  obtain  title to a
     Mortgaged  Property as a result of foreclosure or otherwise,  and shall not
     otherwise acquire  possession of, or take any other action with respect to,
     any  Mortgaged  Property,  if, as a result of any such  action,  Farmer Mac
     would be considered to hold title to, to be a "mortgagee-in-possession" of,
     or to be an "owner" or "operator"  of, such Mortgaged  Property  within the
     meaning of any  Environmental  Statute or a  "discharger"  or  "responsible
     party" thereunder, unless the Central Servicer has prepared or caused to be
     prepared  an  Environmental  Review  Report and  obtained  any  consents in
     connection  therewith  as shall be required by the  Securities  Guide.  The
     Central Servicer shall foreclose upon or otherwise  comparably  convert the
     ownership of Mortgaged  Properties  securing such of the Qualified Loans as
     come  into  and  continue  in  default  and  as to  which  no  arrangements
     consistent with this Agreement and the Securities  Guide have been made for
     collection of delinquent  payments  pursuant to Section 3.02. In connection
     with such  foreclosure  or other  conversion,  and in  connection  with any
     restoration of any Mortgaged  Property after  foreclosure or conversion and
     before disposal  thereof,  the Central Servicer shall follow such practices
     and  procedures  as it shall  deem,  in its  best  judgment,  necessary  or
     advisable in  accordance  with  applicable  law and as shall be required or
     permitted by this  Agreement  and the  Securities  Guide.  The foregoing is
     subject to the proviso that the Central Servicer shall not be authorized to
     incur expenses in connection with any foreclosure or conversion, or towards
     the  restoration of any property,  unless it shall  determine in good faith
     that such  conversion,  foreclosure  and/or  restoration  will increase the
     proceeds  of  liquidation  of  the  Qualified  Loan  to  Farmer  Mac  after
     reimbursement  for the  expenses  therefor.  In the event that the  Central
     Servicer  makes such a  determination,  it shall  advance  any  Liquidation
     Expenses  from its own funds.  Any  Liquidation  Expenses  incurred  by the
     Central  Servicer in accordance with the foregoing shall be reimbursable to
     the Central Servicer,  out of REO Proceeds or Liquidation Proceeds relating
     to such Qualified Loan in accordance  with Section  3.04(a)(iii) as if such
     costs were contained in a Central  Servicer  Advance.  The Central Servicer
     shall be entitled to receive interest on such  Liquidation  Expenses to the
     extent such interest is collected  under the terms of the related  Mortgage
     Note; provided,  however, that, the Central Servicer shall only be entitled
     to such  interest  after an  aggregate  amount  equal to the sum of (i) the
     outstanding  principal balance of the related Qualified Loan; (ii) interest
     accrued and unpaid on such  Qualified  Loan at the  applicable Net Mortgage
     Rate; and (iii) any applicable Yield Maintenance  Amount has been deposited
     in the Remittance Account with respect to such Qualified Loan.

          (ii)  If  the  Environmental   Review  Report  discloses  any  adverse
     information  with  respect to any  Mortgaged  Property or if any  questions
     required  to be  answered  in the  Environmental  Review  Report  cannot be
     answered,  the Central Servicer shall either (x) recommend to Farmer Mac in
     writing that  foreclosure,  trustee's sale or a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure
     should be  delayed  or  abandoned,  stating  the  reasons  for the  Central
     Servicer's  conclusions and attaching a copy of Part I of the Environmental
     Review Report or (y) conduct Phase II of an  Environmental  Review (as such
     terms are defined in the Securities Guide).

          (iii)  If  the  Environmental   Review  Report  or  Phase  II  of  the
     Environmental  Review discloses the presence,  disposal,  escape,  seepage,
     leakage,  spillage,  discharge,  emission, release or threatened release of
     any Hazardous Materials on, from or affecting the Mortgaged Property and if
     the cost of  eliminating  such  Hazardous  Materials  exceeds the potential
     recovery  upon  liquidation  of the  related  Qualified  Loan  the  Central
     Servicer  shall not allow such  Qualified  Loan to become an REO  Qualified
     Loan and shall take such  action as it deems to be in the best  interest of
     Farmer Mac, including, if the Central Servicer deems it so appropriate, and
     after making reasonable  efforts to locate a purchaser,  the release of all
     or a portion of the lien of the related Mortgage.

     (b) In the event that title to any  Mortgaged  Property is acquired for the
benefit of Farmer Mac (or Farmer Mac's assignee or designee) in foreclosure,  by
delivery of a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure or otherwise, the named grantee of the
deed or  certificate  of sale shall be "First  Trust  National  Association,  as
Custodian/Trustee"  or such successor  custodian/trustee as identified by Farmer
Mac. The Central  Servicer,  on behalf of Farmer Mac, shall use its best efforts
to dispose of any REO Property in a reasonably  expeditious manner and otherwise
in accordance with any applicable Environmental Statute.

     (c) The Central Servicer shall  separately  account for all funds collected
and  received in  connection  with the  operation of any REO Property in the REO
Account.  The  aggregate of the amounts  deposited  in the REO Account  during a
Collection  Period in respect of an REO Property  pursuant to this Section shall
be allocated first to all amounts  payable to the Central  Servicer with respect
to such REO Property or the related  Qualified Loan pursuant to this Section and
remaining  unpaid,  second to all interest  accrued and unpaid  thereon from the
last date to which  interest  was paid by the  Borrower  (or deemed to have been
paid through previous  applications to interest  pursuant to this clause second)
and third to any REO  Principal  Amortization  Amount.  Interest and earnings on
funds deposited in the REO Account shall accrue to the benefit of Farmer Mac.

     (d) The Central Servicer shall have full power and authority,  subject only
to the specific  requirements and prohibitions of this Agreement,  to do any and
all things in connection with any REO Property as are consistent with the manner
in which the Central Servicer manages and operates similar property owned by the
Central Servicer or any of its Affiliates, all on such terms and for such period
as the  Central  Servicer  deems to be in the best  interests  of Farmer Mac. In
connection  therewith,  the  Central  Servicer  shall  deposit,  or  cause to be
deposited,  on a daily basis in the REO Account all revenues received by it with
respect to the related REO Property and shall withdraw therefrom funds necessary
for the proper operation, management and maintenance of the related REO Property
including:

               (i) all insurance  premiums due and payable in respect of any REO
          Property;

               (ii)all real estate taxes and  assessments  in respect of any REO
          Property that may result in the imposition of a lien thereon; and

               (iii)all  costs and  expenses  necessary  to maintain and operate
          such REO Property.

     To the extent that  amounts on deposit in the REO Account are  insufficient
for the  purposes  set forth in (i) through  (iii) above with respect to any REO
Property,  the Central  Servicer shall advance from its own funds such amount as
is necessary for such purposes if, but only if, the Central  Servicer would make
such  advances if the Central  Servicer  owned such REO  Property and if, in the
Central  Servicer's  good faith business  judgment,  the payment of such amounts
will be recoverable from the operation or sale of that REO Property.

     (e) The  Central  Servicer  on behalf of Farmer Mac may  contract  with any
Independent  contractor  for the operation  and  management of any REO Property,
provided that:

               (i) the terms and  conditions of any such  contract  shall not be
          inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement;

               (ii) any such contract shall require, or shall be administered to
          require,  that the  Independent  contractor pay all costs and expenses
          incurred in connection  with the operation and  management of such REO
          Property, including those listed above, and remit all related revenues
          (net of such costs and  expenses)  to the Central  Servicer as soon as
          practicable,  but in no event  later than thirty  days  following  the
          receipt thereof by such Independent contractor;

               (iii) none of the provisions of this Section 3.07(e)  relating to
          any such  contract or to actions  taken  through any such  Independent
          contractor  shall be deemed to relieve the Central  Servicer of any of
          its duties and obligations to Farmer Mac with respect to the operation
          and management of any such REO Property; and

               (iv) the Central Servicer shall be obligated with respect thereto
          to the same  extent as if it alone  were  performing  all  duties  and
          obligations  in connection  with the operation and  management of such
          REO Property.

     The Central Servicer shall be entitled to enter into any agreement with any
Independent  contractor  performing  services  for it  related to its duties and
obligations  hereunder  for  indemnification  of the  Central  Servicer  by such
Independent  contractor,  and nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to limit
or modify such  indemnification.  The Central  Servicer  (provided  it act as an
independent contractor with respect to properties held by other entities) or any
Independent  contractor  shall be  entitled  to a fee,  based on the  prevailing
market rate (determined  after  consultation with Farmer Mac), for the operation
and management of any REO Property. If such fee is not covered by gross revenues
from the  related  REO  Property,  the  Central  Servicer  or other  Independent
contractor shall be paid by Farmer Mac for all fees owed it.

     (f) On or before each Remittance  Date, the Central Servicer shall withdraw
from the REO Account and deposit  into the  Collection  Account Net REO Proceeds
received  or  collected  during  the  related  Collection  Period  less  amounts
reasonably  anticipated to be needed to pay recurring  expenses  relating to REO
Properties in the next twelve months.

     (g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Central
Servicer  shall have the right but not the  obligation to purchase any Qualified
Loan  from  Farmer  Mac at such  time as such  Qualified  Loan  comes  into  and
continues in default for a period of at least 90 days.  If the Central  Servicer
exercises  its right so to  purchase,  the Central  Servicer  shall  deposit the
Purchase Price with respect to such defaulted Qualified Loan into the Collection
Account not later than the Remittance Date next succeeding the Collection Period
during  which the  Central  Servicer  notifies  Farmer Mac of its  intention  to
purchase such defaulted Qualified Loan.

     (i) If  applicable  state law permits an action for a deficiency  judgment,
the  Central  Servicer  shall  have the  right to  determine  whether  to seek a
deficiency  judgment or enforce any  applicable  additional  security  documents
following  foreclosure,  exercising its good faith business judgment in the same
manner as it would if it had been the owner of the related Qualified Loan.

     (j) The Central  Servicer  shall neither be required to take nor to omit to
take any  action in any case where such  action or  omission,  in its good faith
business judgment,  would cause it to be liable under an Environmental  Statute.
If the Central Servicer  determines that any action or omission would so subject
it to such liability, it shall promptly notify Farmer Mac.

     Section 3.08. Farmer Mac to Cooperate; Release of Mortgage Files.

     (a) Upon receipt of the payment in full of any Qualified  Loan, or upon the
receipt by the Central  Servicer of a notification  that payment in full will be
escrowed in a manner  customary for such  purposes,  the Central  Servicer shall
immediately  notify  Farmer  Mac  (or  its  designee)  by a  certification  of a
Servicing   Officer  in  form   reasonably   acceptable  to  Farmer  Mac  (which
certification  shall include a statement to the effect that all amounts received
or to be received in  connection  with such payment  required to be deposited in
the  Collection  Account  pursuant  to  Section  3.02  have  been  or will be so
deposited) and shall request  delivery to it of the Mortgage File.  Upon receipt
of such  certification and request,  Farmer Mac shall cause the related Mortgage
File to be released to the Central  Servicer  and the request for  reconveyance,
deed of  reconveyance  or release or satisfaction of mortgage or such instrument
releasing  or  reassigning  the lien of the  Mortgage  prepared  by the  Central
Servicer,  together with the Mortgage Note with written evidence of cancellation
thereon to be executed and delivered to the Central  Servicer.  Farmer Mac shall
cause the Mortgage File to be released and such other  documents or  instruments
in  accordance  with this  Section 3.08 to be executed  and  delivered  promptly
(generally  within 2 Business Days) after receipt by Farmer Mac of the foregoing
request.  No expenses  incurred in connection  with  recording any instrument of
satisfaction  or deed of  reconveyance  shall be  chargeable  to the  Collection
Account.

     (b) From time to time as is appropriate for the servicing or foreclosure of
any  Qualified  Loan,  Farmer Mac shall cause the related  Mortgage  File or any
document  therein to be  delivered  to the Central  Servicer  upon Farmer  Mac's
receipt of a request for release (in form  satisfactory  to Farmer Mac) from the
Central Servicer requesting delivery of such file or document.  Farmer Mac shall
cause such release promptly  (generally  within 2 Business Days after receipt by
Farmer Mac of the  foregoing  request for release.  The Central  Servicer  shall
return each Mortgage File or any document therein so released to Farmer Mac when
the need  therefor by the  Central  Servicer  no longer  exists,  unless (i) the
Qualified Loan has been liquidated and the Liquidation  Proceeds relating to the
Qualified  Loan  have  been  deposited  in the  Collection  Account  or (ii) the
Mortgage  File or such  document  has been  delivered to any  attorney,  or to a
public  trustee or other  public  official as required by law,  for  purposes of
initiating or pursuing legal action or other  proceedings for the foreclosure of
the  Mortgaged  Property  either  judicially or  nonjudicially,  and the Central
Servicer  has  delivered  to Farmer Mac a  certificate  of a  Servicing  Officer
certifying  as to the name and address of the Person to which such Mortgage File
or such document was delivered and the purpose or purposes of such delivery.  In
the event of the  liquidation  of a Qualified  Loan,  Farmer Mac shall cause the
request for release with respect thereto to be delivered to the Central Servicer
upon deposit of the related  Liquidation  Proceeds in the Collection Account and
the Central Servicer's request for delivery of the request for release.

     (c)  Farmer Mac shall  cause the  execution  and  delivery  to the  Central
Servicer of any court pleadings,  requests for trustee's sale or other documents
prepared by the Central  Servicer  and  necessary to the  foreclosure  or Farmer
Mac's sale,  bankruptcy  sale or work out  settlement  in respect of a Mortgaged
Property or to any legal action brought to obtain judgment  against any Borrower
on the Mortgage Note, Mortgage or Additional Collateral Documents or to obtain a
deficiency judgment,  or to enforce any other remedies or rights provided by the
Mortgage  Note,  Mortgage  or  Additional   Collateral  Documents  or  otherwise
available at law or in equity.  Together with such  documents or pleadings,  the
Central  Servicer  shall  deliver to Farmer  Mac a  certificate  of a  Servicing
Officer  requesting that such pleadings or documents be caused to be executed by
Farmer Mac and  certifying  as to the reason such  documents  or  pleadings  are
required and that the execution  and delivery  thereof will not  invalidate  any
insurance  coverage  under  any  required  insurance  policy  or  invalidate  or
otherwise affect the lien of the Mortgage,  except for the termination of such a
lien upon completion of the foreclosure or trustee's sale.

     Section 3.09. Servicing and Other Compensation.

     (a)  The  Central   Servicer,   as  compensation  for  its  activities  and
obligations  hereunder,  shall be entitled to withhold  (i) from each payment on
account of interest on a Qualified Loan (x) the amount of interest calculated at
the Servicing Fee Rate to the extent, if any, that the interest component of the
payment  received is in excess of interest  calculated  at the Net Mortgage Rate
and (y) the amount, if any, of each such payment representing  interest accruing
on any delinquent  Installment  Payment with respect to which a Central Servicer
Advance has been made by and not reimbursed to the Central  Servicer,  (ii) from
Net REO Proceeds,  the amount, if any, by which the portion thereof allocable to
interest  is in excess of interest  at the Net  Mortgage  Rate but not to exceed
interest at the Servicing Fee Rate for the period deemed to be covered  thereby,
and (iii) from Net  Liquidation  Proceeds the amount,  if any, by which such Net
Liquidation  Proceeds  are in  excess  of the  sum of (x) the  unpaid  principal
balance of the related  Qualified Loan together with accrued and unpaid interest
thereon at the Net Mortgage  Rate to the date of the final  liquidation  thereof
and (y) any applicable Yield Maintenance  Amount,  but not in excess of interest
calculated  at the  Servicing Fee Rate from the date of the last payment of fees
to the Central Servicer with respect to each related Liquidated  Qualified Loan.
The Central Servicer shall also be entitled to additional servicing compensation
in the form of assumption fees, late payment charges,  interest  calculated at a
penalty rate (but only with respect to Installment  Payments for which a Central
Servicer  Advance  is  outstanding)  and  other  service  charges  imposed  upon
Borrowers in connection with servicing the Qualified Loans.

     (b) The Central Servicer shall be required to pay all expenses  incurred by
it in  connection  with its  servicing  activities  hereunder  and  shall not be
entitled  to  reimbursement  therefor  except as  specifically  provided in this
Agreement or the applicable Central Servicing Supplement.

     Section  3.10.  Access to Certain  Documentation  Regarding  the  Qualified
Loans.

     (a) Upon the prior  written  request of Farmer Mac received  reasonably  in
advance, the Central Servicer shall provide reasonable access to representatives
of Farmer Mac  (including its assignee or designee) to  documentation  regarding
the Qualified  Loans during normal  business hours at the offices of the Central
Servicer   designated   by  it.  The   Central   Servicer   shall   permit  such
representatives  to photocopy any such documentation and shall provide equipment
for that purpose.  The Central Servicer shall forward to Farmer Mac such reports
as may be required by Farmer Mac with  respect to  delinquent  Qualified  Loans,
which  reports shall include  information  broken down by aging of  delinquency,
specifying the Qualified Loans included in each category.

     (b) The Central Servicer shall maintain or cause to be maintained  adequate
books  and  records   pertaining  to  each  Qualified  Loan  serviced  hereunder
including,  but not limited to, copies of all Mortgage  Servicing  Documents and
any  additional  documentation  customarily  contained in an  agricultural  loan
servicing  file.  The  Central  Servicer  agrees  that such  documents  shall be
maintained  until the  earlier  of (a) seven  years  after the  maturity  of the
Qualified  Loan;  and  (b) the  date  such  documentation  is  transferred  to a
successor   servicer   that   shall  have   assumed   the   Central   Servicer's
responsibilities  and  obligations  in  accordance  with  this  Agreement.  Such
documentation  may  be in the  form  of  microfilm,  microfiche,  ledger  cards,
magnetic media or other "machine readable" records, or any combination thereof.

     Section 3.11. Annual Statement as to Compliance.  The Central Servicer will
deliver to Farmer Mac, on or before  March 31 of each year,  beginning  with the
first  March 31 that  occurs at least six  months  after the  Cut-Off  Date,  an

the activities of the Central Servicer during the preceding calendar year and of
its  performance  under  this  Agreement  has been  made  under  such  officer's
supervision; (ii) to the best of such officer's knowledge, based on such review,
the Central  Servicer has fulfilled  all its  obligations  under this  Agreement
throughout  such year, or, if there has been a default in the fulfillment of any
such  obligation,  specifying  each such  default  known to such officer and the
nature and status  thereof;  and (iii) with respect to each Mortgaged  Property,
except as  identified in writing to Farmer Mac, all Hazard  Insurance  Premiums,
assessments,  taxes and other  charges that may become  liens having  precedence
over the related Mortgage have been paid current.

     Section 3.12. Submission of Independent Public Accountants' Reports.

     (a)  Within  120 days after the close of each  fiscal  year of the  Central
Servicer,  beginning with the fiscal year ending in 1996,  the Central  Servicer
shall  deliver  to Farmer Mac a copy of the  report of  Independent  accountants
respecting   the  Central   Servicer's,   or  the  Central   Servicer's   parent
corporation's, consolidated financial statements for the preceding fiscal year.

      (b) On or before September 1 of each year, beginning September 1, 1997,
the Central Servicer shall cause a firm of Independent accountants (who may also
render other services to the Central Servicer) to furnish an agreed upon
procedures report to Farmer Mac indicating that such firm has performed the
procedures set forth as Exhibit A hereto and detailing any findings.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Central Servicer shall cause such reports to
be delivered at such less frequent as Farmer Mac, in its sole discretion,
consents to in writing.

     Section 3.13. Inspections of the Mortgaged Properties. The Central Servicer
shall cause each Mortgaged Property to be physically inspected at least annually
to determine that (a) the Mortgaged  Property has not been abandoned and (b) the
agricultural  activities  conducted thereon appear to be conducted in accordance
with customary and  reasonable  farming  practices.  Such  inspections  shall be
conducted  (i) at no  expense  to  Farmer  Mac,  (ii) by a Person  knowledgeable
regarding  good farming  practices for the  agriculture  being  conducted on the
Mortgaged  Property and (iii) during the  production  season for the  particular
type of agricultural  product being produced thereon. If either of the foregoing
conditions set forth in clauses (a) and (b) above is not present with respect to
any Mortgaged  Property,  the Central  Servicer shall promptly notify Farmer Mac
and shall take such  action  with  respect  thereto as may be  permitted  by the
related Mortgage and as may be reasonably  determined by the Central Servicer to
be in the best interests of Farmer Mac.

     Section 3.14. Partial Releases.  At the request of a Borrower,  the Central
Servicer may release a portion of any  Mortgaged  Property  from the lien of the
related  Mortgage  provided  that:  (i) the  remaining  portion of the Mortgaged
Property  is  reappraised  by an  appraiser  in  accordance  with the  Appraisal
Standards, (ii) the Borrower makes a prepayment in part (and pays any applicable
Yield Maintenance  Amount),  if necessary,  such that the loan-to-value ratio of
the remaining  principal amount of the related  Qualified Loan outstanding after
such partial prepayment to the reappraised value of the remaining portion of the
Mortgaged Property is no greater than the maximum  loan-to-value  ratio provided
for  similar  loans  in the  Securities  Guide,  (iii)  the cash  flow  from the
remaining  portion of the  Mortgaged  Property  is  sufficient  to  service  the
remaining  indebtedness  under the related  Mortgage  Note, and (iv) the Central
Servicer  delivers to Farmer Mac prior to any such  partial  release a Servicing
Officer's  certificate  certifying that such partial release meets the foregoing
conditions of this Section 3.14 and,  subsequent to such partial release, a copy
of the executed partial release with  appropriate  recording  information  noted
thereon.  At the Borrower's  request,  the Central  Servicer will reschedule the
repayment of the  remaining  payments on the  Qualified  Loan to provide for the
amortization of the remaining  principal  balance of the Qualified  Loan,  after
taking into  account the  prepayment  related to the partial  release,  over the
remaining term of the Qualified Loan. Any prepayments  (and any applicable Yield
Maintenance  Amounts)  received  by the Central  Servicer  pursuant to a partial
release shall be deposited in the Collection  Account and the prepayments  shall
be treated for all  purposes of this  Agreement  as partial  prepayments  on the
Qualified Loans.

     Section  3.15.  Servicing  Agreements  between  Central  Servicer and Field
Servicers.  The Central Servicer may enter into Servicing  Agreements with Field
Servicers who satisfy the  requirements  set forth in the Securities Guide for a
portion of the  servicing of some or all of the Qualified  Loans.  References in
this  Agreement  to  actions  taken or to be taken by the  Central  Servicer  in
servicing  the Qualified  Loans include  actions taken or to be taken by a Field
Servicer on behalf of the Central  Servicer.  Each  Servicing  Agreement will be
upon such terms and conditions as are permitted by the Securities  Guide and are
not  inconsistent  with this Agreement and as the Central Servicer and the Field
Servicer have agreed. The Central Servicer and the Field Servicer may enter into
amendments thereto or different forms of Servicing Agreements and nothing herein
shall be deemed to limit in any respect the  discretion of the Central  Servicer
to modify or enter into different Servicing Agreements;  provided, however, that
any such  amendments or different forms shall not violate the provisions of this
Agreement or the Securities Guide.

      Section 3.16. Successor Field Servicers. The Central Servicer shall be
entitled to terminate any Servicing Agreement in accordance with the terms and
conditions of such Servicing Agreement and without any limitation by virtue of
this Agreement; provided, however, that in the event of termination of any
Servicing Agreement by the Central Servicer or the Field Servicer, the Central
Servicer shall either act as Field Servicer of the related Qualified Loan or
enter into a Servicing Agreement with a successor Field Servicer which will be
bound by the terms of a Servicing Agreement entered into with such successor
Field Servicer. The Central Servicer shall notify Farmer Mac of any termination
of any Field Servicer.

     Section  3.17.  Liability  of the  Central  Servicer.  Notwithstanding  any
Servicing  Agreement,  any of the  provisions  of  this  Agreement  relating  to
agreements or arrangements  between the Central  Servicer or a Field Servicer or
reference to actions  taken through a Field  Servicer or otherwise,  the Central
Servicer  shall remain  obligated  and liable to Farmer Mac for the servicing of
the Qualified  Loans in accordance  with the  provisions of Section 3.01 without
diminution  of  such  obligation  or  liability  by  virtue  of  such  Servicing
Agreements  or  arrangements  or by  virtue  of  indemnification  from the Field
Servicer  and to the same extent and under the same terms and  conditions  as if
the Central Servicer alone were servicing and administering the Qualified Loans.
For  purposes  of  the  foregoing,  amounts  received  by a  Field  Servicer  in
connection  with a Qualified  Loan or REO Property  shall be deemed to have been
received by the Central  Servicer.  The  Central  Servicer  shall be entitled to
enter  into any  agreement  with a Field  Servicer  for  indemnification  of the
Central  Servicer  and nothing  contained in this  Agreement  shall be deemed to
limit or modify such indemnification.

     Section 3.18. No Contractual Relationship Between Field Servicer and Farmer
Mac  .  Any  Servicing  Agreement  that  may  be  entered  into  and  any  other
transactions  or services  relating  to the  Qualified  Loans  involving a Field
Servicer  in its  capacity  as such  shall be  deemed  to be  between  the Field
Servicer and the Central Servicer alone.  Farmer Mac shall not be deemed a party
thereto and shall have no claims,  rights,  obligations,  duties or  liabilities
with respect to the Central  Servicer or any Field Servicer under such Servicing
Agreements except as set forth in Section 3.19.

     Section 3.19.  Assumption or Termination of Servicing  Agreements by Farmer
Mac.

     (a) In the event that the Central  Servicer  shall for any reason no longer
be acting as such  hereunder  (including  by reason of an Event of Default)  and
Farmer  Mac or its  designee  shall  have  assumed  the  duties  of the  Central
Servicer,  Farmer Mac or such  designee  may, at Farmer  Mac's sole  discretion,
thereupon assume all of the rights and obligations of the Central Servicer under
each  Servicing  Agreement  that may have  been  entered  into.  Each  Servicing
Agreement shall contain provisions allowing Farmer Mac to rescind such agreement
without  penalty in the event the Central  Servicer shall no longer be acting as
such. Farmer Mac, its designee or the successor servicer for Farmer Mac shall be
deemed to have  assumed all of the Central  Servicer's  interest  therein and to
have replaced the Central Servicer as a party to each Servicing Agreement to the
same extent as if such agreement had been assigned to the assuming party, except
that the Central  Servicer  shall not thereby be  relieved of any  liability  or
obligations  under any  Servicing  Agreement  which arose prior to the date each
Servicing Agreement is deemed so assigned and assumed.

     (b) The  Central  Servicer  shall,  upon  request  of Farmer Mac but at the
expense of the Central Servicer: (i) deliver to the assuming party all documents
and records held by the Central  Servicer  relating to each Servicing  Agreement
and the  Qualified  Loans  then  being  serviced  and an  accounting  of amounts
collected  and held by it; (ii)  prepare,  execute and deliver all documents and
instruments  and take all  actions  reasonably  requested  by Farmer  Mac or its
designee to effect the  succession  by Farmer Mac or its designee  hereunder and
the transfer of each Servicing  Agreement to the assuming  party;  and (iii) and
otherwise  use its best efforts to effect the orderly and  efficient  succession
hereunder and transfer of each Servicing Agreement to the assuming party.

     If an Event of Default  shall occur,  then,  and in each and every case, so

obligations  of the  Central  Servicer  under this  Agreement  and in and to the
Qualified Loans and the proceeds  thereof;  provided,  that any liability of the
Central Servicer under this Agreement  arising prior to such  termination  shall
survive  such  termination.  On or after the receipt by the Central  Servicer of
such written notice,  all authority and power of the Central Servicer under this
Agreement  shall pass to and be vested in Farmer Mac; and,  without  limitation,
Farmer Mac is hereby authorized and empowered to execute and deliver,  on behalf
of the Central Servicer, as attorney-in-fact or otherwise, any and all documents
and  other  instruments,  and to do or  accomplish  all  other  acts  or  things
necessary or appropriate  to effect the purposes of such notice of  termination,
whether to complete the transfer and  endorsement or assignment of the Qualified
Loans and related  documents,  or otherwise.  If an Event of Default shall occur
and be continuing,  the Central  Servicer agrees to cooperate with Farmer Mac in
effecting the termination of the Central Servicer's  responsibilities and rights
hereunder,  including,  without  limitation,  the transfer to Farmer Mac (or its
designee) for  administration  by it of all cash amounts which shall at the time
be on deposit in the  Collection  Account or the REO  Account or  thereafter  be
received with respect to the Qualified Loans, the delivery to Farmer Mac (or its
designee) of all  documents  and records  requested by it to enable it to assume
the Central  Servicer's  obligations  hereunder and the reconciliation of all of
the Qualified Loans, the Collection Account and the REO Account, all at the cost
of the  Central  Servicer.  Farmer  Mac or its  designee  shall  pay over to the
Central  Servicer that portion of any future  proceeds of the  Qualified  Loans,
which, if the Central  Servicer were at the time acting  hereunder,  it would be
permitted to receive in  consideration  of, or in  reimbursement  for,  previous
services  performed,  or advances made, by it, net of any amounts owing from the
Central Servicer to Farmer Mac.

delivered to Farmer Mac now, and at any  reasonable  time or times  hereafter at

notices,  reports,  acceptances,  receipts,  consents,  waivers,  affidavits and
certificates  as Farmer Mac may  reasonably  request,  in form  satisfactory  to
Farmer Mac in order to  consummate  fully all of the  transactions  contemplated
hereunder.

     Section 2.04.  Sale,  Transfer or Pledge of Portfolio or Servicing  Rights.
(a) During the Commitment Term, except to the extent provided in the Farm Credit
Act of 1971, as amended,  the Seller shall not pledge or hypothecate  all or any
portion of the Portfolio or any of the rights  associated with the Portfolio and
the Qualified Loans  (including  rights to service the Qualified Loans or rights
to servicing  fee income).  The Seller may sell or transfer the Portfolio or the
servicing  rights  associated  with the Qualified Loans only under the terms set
forth below.

               (i) Farmer Mac will approve the sale or transfer of the Portfolio
          only  if all of the  Qualified  Loans  in the  Portfolio  are  sold or
          transferred to a purchaser or transferee  that is acceptable to Farmer
          Mac  and  that  agrees  to  assume  all  of the  Seller's  obligations
          hereunder pursuant to a written agreement among the Seller, Farmer Mac
          and such  successor  party.  If the  Seller  transfers  or  sells  the
          Portfolio  but retains the right to service the Qualified  Loans,  the
          written agreement among the Seller, Farmer Mac and the successor party
          shall also provide that the payment of the Standby  Purchase Fee shall
          remain a corporate obligation of the Seller.

               (ii)  Farmer Mac will  approve the sale of the  servicing  rights
          associated with the Qualified Loans only if such servicing is sold (a)
          with respect to all Qualified Loans and (b) to one successor  servicer
          acceptable to Farmer Mac that agrees,  pursuant to a written agreement
          among the  Seller,  Farmer  Mac and such  successor  servicer,  to the
          obligations of the Seller set forth herein.

               (iii)  Any  sale  or  transfer  of the  Portfolio  or the  rights
          associated  with the  Portfolio  will be subject to a transfer  fee of
          [material omitted pursuant to a request for confidential treatment and
          filed  separately  with the SEC] of the aggregate  outstanding  unpaid
          principal  balance of the Qualified Loans in the Portfolio at the time
          of the transfer or sale.

               (iv) Upon such  transfer,  the Seller shall have no further right
          to include additional Qualified Loans in the Portfolio.

     (b) In  addition  to the  provisions  in  each of the  Servicing  Contracts
concerning the assignment of the Seller's servicing rights and obligations,  the
Seller,  except  to  the  extent  heretofore  provided,   shall  not  pledge  or
hypothecate  all or any  portion of the  remainder  of its  Farmer Mac  mortgage
servicing  portfolio without providing evidence  acceptable to Farmer Mac of the
acknowledgement  of any third party who will have rights therein of Farmer Mac's
entitlement to all or a portion of the value of such  servicing  portfolio in an
Event of Default hereunder.

     Section 2.05.  Indemnification.  The Seller shall indemnify and hold Farmer
Mac harmless from and against any and all losses, claims,  damages,  liabilities
and  expenses  (including  reasonable  costs  of  investigation)  (collectively,
"Losses")  to which Farmer Mac may become  subject  insofar as such Losses arise
out  of or are  based  upon  (i)  the  Seller's  performance  of  its  servicing
obligations  set  forth in this  Commitment  and the  Servicing  Contracts  with
respect to the Qualified  Loans in the Portfolio  prior to sale of the Qualified
Loans to Farmer Mac or (ii) a final  adjudication  of,  including any settlement
of, any outstanding  litigation  described in Exhibit C hereto. This covenant to
indemnify  and hold harmless  shall  survive the sale of the Qualified  Loans to
Farmer Mac.

     Section  2.06.  Original  Principal  Balance.   Notwithstanding  any  other
provision of this  Commitment,  the Seller shall not deliver a Qualified Loan to
Farmer Mac for sale if the original  principal  balance of such  Qualified  Loan
does not meet Farmer Mac's maximum dollar purchase limitations,  in effect as of
the Delivery Date, for the purchase of similar  Qualified  Loans,  determined in
accordance with the Charter Act.

     Section 2.07.  Seller/Servicer Status. The Seller shall maintain its status
as  a  Farmer  Mac  approved   seller  and  servicer  in  accordance   with  the
Seller/Servicer Agreement and the Servicing Contracts.

covenants to purchase the Qualified  Loans in the  Portfolio in accordance  with
the provisions of this Commitment.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                     PRE-DELIVERY OBLIGATIONS OF THE SELLER

     Section  4.01.  Payment  of  Standby  Purchase  Fee.  With  respect to each
Qualified Loan, by the seventh  calendar day of each month in which a payment is
scheduled  to be made on such  Qualified  Loan (or, in the case of a  prepayment
with respect to any Qualified  Loan,  by the seventh day of the month  following
the month in which such prepayment is received) beginning in August 1998 (or the
preceding  Business  Day if the  seventh  calendar  day is not a  Business  Day)
through and including the month in which the Commitment Term expires, the Seller
shall pay to Farmer Mac in immediately  available funds, by 12:00 noon,  Eastern
time, on such seventh day, an amount sufficient to pay the Standby Purchase Fee.
If such funds are not  received by Farmer Mac by 12:00 noon,  Eastern  time,  on
such  seventh  day,  the Seller shall pay interest to Farmer Mac on such overdue
amount at a rate equal to the federal funds rate.

     Section 4.02.  Delivery of Qualified Loan  Information.  (a) Not later than
the tenth day of the month  following the date of execution of this  Commitment,
the Seller shall deliver to Farmer Mac a completed  Qualified  Loan Schedule for
the Qualified  Loans in the  Portfolio.  Such  Qualified  Loan Schedule shall be
delivered in magnetic media or electronic format acceptable to Farmer Mac.

     (b) At any time prior to  December  31,  1999,  the  Seller may  deliver to
Farmer Mac a completed  Qualified  Loan  Schedule for any  additional  Qualified
Loans that the Seller  wishes to add to the  Portfolio.  The Seller shall follow
the same  requirements  for  completion of the initial  Qualified Loan Schedule.
Such Qualified Loans shall become part of the Portfolio,  effective on the first
day of the month following the month of receipt by Farmer Mac of such additional
Qualified  Loan  Schedule.  Any  Standby  Purchase  Fee  with  respect  to  such
additional  Qualified  Loan  shall be due and  payable  beginning  in the  month
following the month in which the Effective Date with respect to such  additional
Qualified  Loan  occurs.  The Seller may not  remove a  Qualified  Loan from the
Portfolio without the prior written consent of Farmer Mac (including  removal by
making a new loan to the  borrower  of such  Qualified  Loan which new loan,  in
whole or in part,  refinances  the  Qualified  Loan) which  consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld;  except, that, if the Seller refinances,  restructures or
modifies any  Qualified  Loan  without the written  consent of Farmer Mac (which
consent shall not be unreasonably  withheld),  Farmer Mac shall not be obligated
to purchase such restructured or modified Qualified Loan.

     Section  4.03.  Administration  and Servicing of Qualified  Loans.  (a) The
Seller  will  diligently  service  the  Qualified  Loans  in  the  Portfolio  in
accordance  with the servicing  standards set forth in the applicable  Servicing
Contract,  except as modified by this  Commitment.  The Seller may conduct  such
servicing through facilities of agents or independent  contractors but shall not
thereby be released from any of its duties or responsibilities hereunder.

     (b) The Seller must maintain an individual mortgage file for each Qualified
Loan in the  Portfolio.  Each  mortgage  file must include any papers or records
that are required by the Servicing Contracts (except assignments of mortgages to
Farmer Mac). The Seller will physically segregate the mortgage notes relating to
the Qualified  Loans in the  Portfolio and hold such mortgage  notes in a secure
environment in accordance  with generally  accepted  industry  standards for the
custody of mortgage loan  documentation.  The Seller will maintain each mortgage
note in a fire resistant vault, drawer or other suitable depository.  The Seller
is responsible for maintaining accurate accounting and borrower payment records,
as required in the Servicing Contracts.

     (c) Upon reasonable notice and at any reasonable time during the Commitment
Term and subject to applicable confidentiality requirements,  Farmer Mac has the
right to examine any and all books and  records  that  pertain to the  Qualified
Loans,  any and all accounting  reports  associated with the Qualified Loans and
borrower  remittances,  and any other reports and documentation  that Farmer Mac
considers  necessary to assure that (i) the  Qualified  Loans meet the terms and
conditions set forth herein and (ii) the Seller is servicing the Qualified Loans
in compliance with the Servicing Contracts and this Commitment. Seller agrees to
forward  such books,  records or reports (or copies  thereof) to Farmer Mac upon
request by Farmer Mac.

     (d) The Seller shall service delinquent  Qualified Loans in accordance with
the provisions of the applicable Servicing Contract, including timely initiation
of loss  mitigation  efforts.  However,  the  Seller  must  sell the  delinquent
Qualified Loan to Farmer Mac prior to completion of the foreclosure  process (or
other comparable conversion) in accordance with Section 5.01 hereof. If title to
the underlying  mortgaged property has transferred to the Seller and no right of
rescission  by the  borrower  exists,  the related  Qualified  Loan is no longer
eligible  for sale to  Farmer  Mac and  should  be  reported  as a  "payoff"  in
accordance with the requirements of Section 4.04.

     Section 4.04 Reporting  Requirements.  Not later than the last Business Day
of the month in which a  Qualified  Loan is added to the  Portfolio,  the Seller
shall provide a loan setup file in a machine-readable  format in accordance with
the tape  specifications  set forth in Exhibit D, E or F hereto, as appropriate.
Thereafter  and until the  Qualified  Loan is sold to  Farmer  Mac or  otherwise
removed from the Portfolio,  the Seller shall provide not later than the seventh
calendar  day of each  month a monthly  loan  activity  report  (based on actual
payment  activity)  in a  machine-readable  format in  accordance  with the tape
specifications set forth in Exhibit G hereto.

                                    ARTICLE V

                   DELIVERY OF AND PAYMENT FOR QUALIFIED LOANS

     Section 5.01. Tier I Qualified  Loans.  (a) Subject to the requirements set
forth in this  Commitment,  the  Seller  may  elect to sell to  Farmer  Mac,  in
exchange for cash,  any Tier I Qualified  Loan.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,
prior to transfer of ownership of a mortgaged  property from the borrower to the
Seller as a result of loss mitigation efforts, a foreclosure proceeding or other
comparable  conversion,  the Seller  shall sell to Farmer Mac the related Tier I
Qualified  Loan  regardless of the amount of time such  Qualified  Loan has been
delinquent.

     (b) The purchase price for any Tier I Qualified Loan shall equal the unpaid
principal balance of the Qualified Loan less any outstanding borrower stock that
may be retired and applied to the  Qualified  Loan, as reported to Farmer Mac in
accordance  with Section  4.04,  in the month in which the Seller elects to sell
such  Qualified  Loan or,  in the case of the  Tier I  Qualified  Loans in which
Farmer Mac will  purchase a  participation  interest,  the purchase  price shall
equal the  participation  percentage of the amount by which the unpaid principal
balance of the Qualified Loan exceeds such  outstanding  borrower stock, if any.
The  purchase  price for a Tier I Qualified  Loan shall not  include  accrued or
delinquent  interest  or  foreclosure  or  related  costs or  expenses.  Accrued
interest  shall be  recoverable  by the Seller as if it were a Central  Servicer
Delinquency Advance under the applicable  Servicing  Contract,  recoverable only
out of  Liquidation  Proceeds  or other  payments  with  respect  to such Tier I
Qualified Loan. The purchase proceeds, as well as any reimbursement of a portion
of the Standby  Purchase Fee, as described in Section 5.04, will be disbursed by
wire  transfer to the Seller on the first  Business  Day of the month  following
Farmer  Mac's  confirmation  of receipt of a completed  Purchase  Request and as
described in subsection (c) below.

     (c) No later than the seventh Business Day of any month in which the Seller
elects to sell Tier I  Qualified  Loans to Farmer  Mac,  the Seller  will do the
following:

               (i) deliver a Purchase Request and  Certification  electronically
          and in hard copy, in the form of Exhibit C hereto,  listing the Farmer
          Mac loan number and unpaid  principal  balance of the Qualified  Loans
          that have become Tier I Qualified Loans that the Seller wishes to sell
          to Farmer Mac either as whole loans or  participation  interests.  The
          Purchase  Request and  Certification  shall be delivered to Farmer Mac
          via facsimile transmission (number 202-872-7713).

               (ii)   prepare  and  deliver   all  of  the   mortgage   delivery
          documentation  required pursuant to Chapter 302 of the Seller/Servicer
          Guide to Farmer Mac in accordance with the Seller/Servicer Guide. Only
          Farmer Mac's loan records shall determine the proceeds that the Seller
          is entitled to receive for Farmer  Mac's  purchase of Tier I Qualified
          Loans.

               (iii) pay directly to the custodian  designated by Farmer Mac any
          custodial  fees to be  incurred  in  connection  with the  filing  and
          maintenance of the mortgage documents by such custodian.

     (d) As of its Delivery Date, a Tier I Qualified Loan sold to Farmer Mac (or
as to which a participation is sold to Farmer Mac) shall no longer be subject to
the terms of this  Commitment  and shall be serviced by the Seller in accordance
with the standard servicing provisions of the applicable Servicing Contract.

     (e) The Seller and Farmer Mac agree that,  if a Tier I Qualified  Loan sold
to  Farmer  Mac   subsequently   becomes  current  in  payments   without  being
restructured,  the Seller  will  repurchase  from Farmer Mac and Farmer Mac will
sell to the Seller such Qualified Loan for a price equal to the unpaid principal
balance plus any accrued  interest on such Qualified  Loan.  Such Qualified Loan
will  thereafter be listed on the  applicable  Qualified  Loan Schedule and be a
part of the Portfolio subject to this Commitment.

     Section 5.02. Tier II Qualified  Loans. (a) Subject to the requirements set
forth in this Commitment,  the Seller may elect to sell to Farmer Mac, from time
to time, at any time during the  Commitment  Term, in exchange for cash or AMBS,
some or all Tier II  Qualified  Loans,  subject  to Farmer  Mac's  then  current
requirements  for its Cash Window  Program for cash  purchases  or its AMBS Swap
Program.  The purchase price for a Tier II Qualified Loan sold to Farmer Mac for
cash  shall be the price  agreed to by Farmer  Mac and the Seller at the time of
sale for cash  transactions  (less any  outstanding  borrower  stock that may be
retired and applied to the Qualified  Loan).  The guarantee fee to be charged to
the Seller for any Tier II  Qualified  Loan sold to Farmer Mac in  exchange  for
AMBS  shall  be:  [material  omitted  pursuant  to a  request  for  confidential
treatment and filed separately with the SEC]

     (b) Prior to the removal of a Tier II  Qualified  Loan from the  Portfolio,
the Seller will contact Farmer Mac to enter into a mandatory  commitment to sell
such Tier II Qualified Loan to Farmer Mac under the standard  mortgage  delivery
and sale  requirements set forth in the  Seller/Servicer  Guide. In the month in
which the  Seller  elects to sell Tier II  Qualified  Loans to Farmer  Mac,  the
Seller will report, in accordance with the loan level reporting requirements set
forth in Section 4.04, the removal of the Qualified Loan from this Commitment by
reporting a zero unpaid principal balance.

     (c) The Seller shall sell Tier II Qualified  Loans pursuant to subparagraph
(a) in the case of a cash purchase,  in the month in which the Qualified Loan is
removed from this Commitment  and, in the case of an AMBS purchase,  in the next
month  after  the  month  in which  the  Qualified  Loan is  removed  from  this
Commitment.

     (d) No later than the last  Business Day of the month of the sale to Farmer
Mac of Tier II Qualified  Loans in exchange for AMBS,  the Seller shall supply a
Loan Setup File (as defined in the applicable Servicing Contract) including each
such Tier II Qualified Loan.

     (e) As of its Delivery  Date,  a Tier II Qualified  Loan sold to Farmer Mac
(or as to which a  participation  is sold to  Farmer  Mac)  shall no  longer  be
subject to the terms of this  Commitment  and shall be serviced by the Seller in
accordance with the standard  servicing  provisions of the applicable  Servicing
Contract.

     Section 5.03. Tier III Qualified Loans. (a) Subject to the requirements set
forth in this  Commitment,  the Seller may make a one-time  election  to sell to
Farmer Mac, in exchange for cash, all of the Tier III Qualified Loans; provided,
however,  the Seller  must  concurrently  sell all Tier I and Tier II  Qualified
Loans to Farmer  Mac in  accordance  with the terms  set forth  herein  for such
sales.

     (b) The Seller must contact Farmer Mac if at any time during the Commitment
Term it wishes to enter into a one-time  mandatory  delivery  commitment to sell
all of the Tier III  Qualified  Loans to Farmer Mac. The purchase  price for the
Tier III  Qualified  Loans  shall be  negotiated  at the time of sale  (less any
outstanding  borrower  stock that may be retired  and  applied to the  Qualified
Loan).

     (c) In the event the Seller elects to sell all Tier III Qualified  Loans to
Farmer Mac,  Farmer Mac will provide  instructions  to the Seller  regarding the
required  reporting  relating to such Qualified Loans prior to their delivery to
Farmer Mac.

     (d) As of its Delivery  Date, a Tier III Qualified  Loan sold to Farmer Mac
(or as to which a  participation  is sold to  Farmer  Mac)  shall no  longer  be
subject to the terms of this  Commitment  and shall be serviced by the Seller in
accordance with the standard  servicing  provisions of the applicable  Servicing
Contract.

     Section 5.04.  Participation  Interests. (a) Upon election by the Seller to
deliver a Class I, Class II or Class III  Qualified  Loan to Farmer Mac pursuant
of this  Commitment,  Farmer Mac shall be entitled to perform such due diligence
as to allow it to determine the value of the related  mortgaged  property at the
time of purchase by Farmer Mac. In the event that (i) Farmer Mac determines that
the  outstanding  principal  balance of such  Qualified Loan exceeds the maximum
loan-to-value  ratio for eligibility  for the appropriate  Farmer Mac program at
the time of purchase by Farmer Mac and (ii) if  applicable,  such Qualified Loan
is not insured or guaranteed by a qualified  mortgage insurer approved by Farmer
Mac,  Farmer Mac shall so notify the Seller and shall  purchase  only a pro rata
participation  interest  in such  Qualified  Loan.  Such pro rata  participation
interest shall be calculated to result in the  loan-to-value  ratio (based on an
appraisal  performed in accordance with the Appraisal Standards set forth in the
Seller/Servicer Guide) of Farmer Mac's participation interest being equal to the
maximum  loan-to-value ratio for eligibility for the appropriate Farmer Mac loan
product.  Upon receipt of such notice,  the Seller may  represent and warrant in
writing that,  notwithstanding  Farmer Mac's  calculation  of the  loan-to-value
ratio of such Qualified Loan, the actual  loan-to-value  ratio of such Qualified
Loan is less than or equal to the maximum  loan-to-value  ratio for  eligibility
for the appropriate  Farmer Mac product.  In such event,  Farmer Mac will accept
delivery of the entire Qualified Loan, subject to the Seller's liability for any
loss resulting from a breach of the  representation and warranty with respect to
loan-to value.

               (b)(i) In the event that  Farmer Mac  accepts  delivery of only a
          participation  interest in a Qualified  Loan as described in paragraph
          (a) above,  Farmer Mac shall reimburse the Seller for a portion of the
          Standby  Purchase Fee collected with respect to such  Qualified  Loan,
          which portion shall be  calculated as described in  subparagraph  (ii)
          below.

               (ii)  The   amount  of   reimbursement   due  to  the  Seller  in
          subparagraph  (i) with  respect to a Qualified  Loan where  Farmer Mac
          purchases a participation  interest shall be the sum of (A) the unpaid
          principal  balance  of such  Qualified  Loan  at the  time  that  such
          Qualified Loan was made subject to this Commitment, as such amount was
          set forth in the related  Qualified  Loan  Schedule  delivered  by the
          Seller to Farmer Mac  pursuant  to Section  4.02(a) and (B) the unpaid
          principal  balance of such  Qualified Loan at the time that the Seller
          elects to  deliver  such  Qualified  Loan to Farmer  Mac  pursuant  to
          paragraph (a) above, which sum is divided by two and multiplied by (C)
          the number of months for which the Seller paid a Standby  Purchase Fee
          with  respect to such  Qualified  Loan,  (D) the Standby  Purchase Fee
          (divided by 12) and (E) the amount by which 1 exceeds  the  percentage
          participation interest purchased by Farmer Mac.

                                   ARTICLE VI

     However,  Farmer  Mac's  remedy  under this Section for an Event of Default
under Section 8.01 (b), (c), (d) or (e) and related to a Qualified Loan(s) shall
be limited to Section  9.01(b) unless the Event of Default  relates to Qualified
Loans with an aggregate unpaid principal  balance  exceeding 5% of the aggregate

in this Article IX; or

     If the  Seller  falls to  comply  with the  provisions  of (b) or (c) above
within  30 days  upon  demand  of  Farmer  Mac,  Farmer  Mac may  terminate  the

party to  exercise  any  right or  remedy  provided  hereunder  upon an Event of

                      FORM OF OPINION OF COUNSEL FOR SELLER

     1. The Seller has been duly  organized  and is validly  existing  as a Farm
Credit Bank in good standing under the laws of the United States of America, has
the full corporate  power to conduct its business as now being  conducted and is
qualified,  or need not be  qualified,  to conduct  its  business  in all of the
states in which it does, or plans to do business.

     2. The Seller has full right,  power and authority to execute,  deliver and
perform its obligations  under the Commitment;  and the Commitment has been duly
authorized, executed and delivered by the Seller; and the Commitment constitutes
the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Seller,  enforceable  against the
Seller by Farmer  Mac in  accordance  with its terms  except to the  extent  (i)
enforcement  thereof may be limited or affected  by any  applicable  bankruptcy,
insolvency, receivership,  reorganization,  moratorium or similar laws affecting
creditors'  rights  generally  as such  laws may be  applied  in the event of an
insolvency or similar  proceeding  affecting the Seller,  or (ii)  principles of
equity may limit the availability of certain remedies.

     3. The individual or individuals who have executed the Commitment on behalf
of the  Seller  have the legal  power,  right and actual  authority  to bind the
Seller to the terms and conditions of the Commitment.

     4. Neither the execution and delivery by the Seller of the Commitment,  nor
the  fulfillment of the terms of the Commitment nor the compliance by the Seller
with any of the  provisions  of the  Commitment  violate any  provisions  of the
articles  of  incorporation/charter  or  bylaws  of the  Seller,  or any  law or
regulations  applicable  to  the  Seller  or  court  decree  known  to  us to be
applicable to the Seller;  and, to the best of our knowledge  (after having made
inquiry with respect thereto),  none of such actions will result in a breach of,
or constitute a default under,  any agreement,  indenture or other instrument to
which the Seller is a party or by which it is bound.

     5. There is not pending or, to the best of our  knowledge,  threatened  any
action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation at law or in equity or before
any court, public board or regulatory agency, against or affecting the Seller or
its assets wherein an unfavorable  decision,  ruling or finding would  adversely
affect the Seller's powers of existence or the validity or enforceability of the
Commitment, or which might result in any material adverse change in the business
condition  (financial or  otherwise) or operation of the Seller,  or which might
adversely  affect the  Seller's  ability to perform  its  obligations  under the
Commitment.

     6. There is no litigation or  investigation  pending or threatened,  or any
judgment or order entered, affecting the Qualified Loans (or any other mortgages
that the Seller is servicing,  which mortgages have interest rate and adjustment
provisions  similar to those contained in the adjustable rate Qualified  Loans),
at law or in equity by or before  any  federal  or state  court or  governmental
instrumentality  or agency having  jurisdiction over the Seller or the Qualified
Loans.

Loans, subject to Farmer Mac's then-current requirements for its Cash Window
Program for cash purchases or its AMBS Swap Program, and any other terms
mutually agreed between the parties at the time of sale.

               (i) Tier II Qualified  Loans sold to Farmer Mac for cash pursuant
          to the  terms of this  section  shall be sold at the  price  agreed by
          Farmer Mac and the  Seller at the time of sale  (less any  outstanding
          borrower stock that may be retired and applied to the Qualified Loan),
          based  on  Farmer  Mac's  then-required  net  yield  for  cash  window
          purchases  of the  same  product  type as such  Qualified  Loans,  and
          without  adjusting  for any  changes  in the credit  relating  to such
          Qualified Loans.

               (ii) Tier II Qualified  Loans  exchanged with Farmer Mac for AMBS
          shall  have an  initial  principal  amount  equal to the  then-current
          principal  balance of the swapped  Tier II  Qualified  Loans and shall
          bear interest initially at a rate equal to the weighted average of the
          then-current  interest rates of such Qualified Loans,  less the sum of
          the  applicable  Guarantee  Fee,  the  Trustee  Fee,  and the  related
          servicing  fee under the Servicing  Contract.  The guarantee fee to be
          charged to the Seller  for any Tier II  Qualified  Loan sold to Farmer
          Mac in  exchange  for AMBS shall be equal to what had been the Standby
          Purchase  Commitment Fee with respect to such  Qualified  Loan. If the
          Seller  requests  the  AMBS be  registered  with  the  Securities  and
          Exchange  Commission  (the  "SEC"),  the  Seller  shall  pay any costs
          associated with such registration, including any legal, accounting and
          SEC fees."

     Section  5.  Subsections  5.03(a)  and (b)  are  amended  to read in  their
entirety as follows:

     "(a) Subject to the  requirements  set forth in this  Commitment  and those
negotiated at the time of sale, the Seller may make a one-time  election to sell
to Farmer  Mac,  in  exchange  for cash or AMBS,  all of the Tier III  Qualified
Loans; provided,  however, the Seller must concurrently sell all Tier I and Tier
II Qualified  Loans to Farmer Mac in accordance  with the terms set forth herein
for such sales.

     (b) The Seller must contact Farmer Mac if at any time during the Commitment
Term it wishes to enter into a one-time  mandatory  delivery  commitment to sell
all of the Tier III Qualified Loans to Farmer Mac.

               (i) Tier III Qualified Loans sold to Farmer Mac for cash pursuant
          to the  terms of this  section  shall be sold at the  price  agreed by
          Farmer Mac and the  Seller at the time of sale  (less any  outstanding
          borrower stock that may be retired and applied to the Qualified Loan),
          based on pricing  of AMBS  collateralized  by such Tier III  Qualified
          Loans, and without adjusting for any changes in the credit relating to
          such Qualified Loans.

               (ii) Tier III Qualified  Loans exchanged with Farmer Mac for AMBS
          shall  have an  initial  principal  amount  equal to the  then-current
          principal  balance of the swapped Tier III  Qualified  Loans and shall
          bear interest initially at a rate equal to the weighted average of the
          then-current  interest rates of such Qualified Loans,  less the sum of
          the  applicable  Guarantee  Fee,  the  Trustee  Fee,  and the  related
          servicing  fee under the Servicing  Contract.  The guarantee fee to be
          charged to the Seller for any Tier III  Qualified  Loan sold to Farmer
          Mac in  exchange  for AMBS shall be equal to what had been the Standby
          Purchase  Commitment Fee with respect to such  Qualified  Loan. If the
          Seller  requests  the  AMBS be  registered  with  the  Securities  and
          Exchange  Commission  (the  "SEC"),  the  Seller  shall  pay any costs
          associated with such registration, including any legal, accounting and
          SEC fees."

     Section 6. A new Section 10.14 is hereby added to read as follows:

     "Section  10.14.  Authorized  Associations.  The  Seller  intends  to place
Qualified  Loans in the Portfolio.  Alternatively,  Seller intends to direct any
one or more of the Associations in its district,  namely those  Associations the
Seller  identifies  as such in  writing  to Farmer  Mac  (each,  an  "Authorized
Association;"),  to place, or commit to place, in the Portfolio on behalf of the
Seller  Qualified  Loans which such  Authorized  Association  has  originated or
purchased. Each of the Authorized Associations will be considered to be a seller
in the Farmer Mac program."

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF,  the parties hereto have caused this Amendment No. 2 to
the  Commitment  to be duly  executed  by  their  duly  authorized  officers  or
representatives as of the date above first written.
