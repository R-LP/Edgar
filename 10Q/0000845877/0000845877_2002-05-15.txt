Note 1.  Accounting Policies

(a)   Cash and Cash Equivalents

     Farmer Mac considers  highly  liquid  investment  securities  with original
maturities  of  three  months  or less to be cash  equivalents.  Changes  in the
balance of cash and cash equivalents are reported in the Condensed  Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows. The following table sets forth  information  regarding
certain cash and non-cash transactions for the three months ended March 31, 2002
and 2001.

</TABLE>


               (b)  Loans

     As of March 31, 2002,  loans held by Farmer Mac included $35.7 million held
for sale and $274.2 million held for investment.  As of December 31, 2001, loans
held by Farmer Mac included  $25.8 million held for sale and $175.8 million held
for investment.

               (c)  Financial Derivatives

     A  financial  derivative  is a  financial  instrument  that has one or more
underlyings and one or more notional  amounts,  requires no significant  initial
net  investment,  and has terms that require net  settlement.  Farmer Mac enters
into  financial  derivative  contracts  as  an  end-user,  not  for  trading  or
speculative  purposes.  Farmer  Mac uses  financial  derivatives  to adjust  the
characteristics  of Farmer  Mac's  debt to match the  characteristics  of Farmer
Mac's mortgage assets.

     When financial  derivatives meet specific criteria,  they are accounted for
as either fair value hedges or cash flow hedges.  Financial  derivatives that do
not satisfy Statement of Financial  Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for
Derivative  Instruments and Hedging  Activities  ("SFAS 133") hedge criteria are
not  accounted  for  as  hedges.  Changes  in  fair  value  of  those  financial
derivatives are reported in income or expense.

     Net after-tax  charges against earnings under SFAS 133 during first quarter
2002 totaled  $145,000,  and the net after-tax  decrease to other  comprehensive
income  totaled $3.2 million.  Substantially  all of this amount  represents the
estimated  present value of the cost of settled  forward sale  contracts and the
net interest payments on interest-rate  swap contracts,  using fair values as of
March 31, 2002 and assuming no change in interest  rates.  Farmer Mac  estimates
that  $710,000  of  the  amount   currently   reported  in   accumulated   other
comprehensive  income will be reclassified  into earnings within the next twelve
months.  The  Corporation  entered into those  interest-rate  swap  contracts to
derive a lower  effective  fixed-rate  cost of borrowing for periods of up to 15
years  than  would  otherwise  have been  available  to the  Corporation  in the
conventional   debt  market.   For  the  quarter  ended  March  31,  2002,   the
ineffectiveness  of  designated  hedges  included in Farmer Mac's net income was
immaterial.

               (d)  Reserve for Losses

     Farmer Mac  maintains  a reserve  for losses to cover  potential  losses on
loans,   including  Qualified  Loans  underlying  Post-1996  Act  Farmer  Mac  I
Securities  and LTSPCs.  The reserve is maintained at a level  management  deems
adequate to cover  potential  principal  losses and interest  losses  related to
loans that are 90 days or more  delinquent.  The  reserve is  increased  through
periodic  provisions  charged to expense and reduced by  charge-offs  for actual
loan losses,  net of  recoveries.  In estimating  potential  losses on loans and
outstanding Farmer Mac guarantees,  management  considers  economic  conditions,
geographic and agricultural commodity concentrations,  the credit profile of the
Qualified  Loans,  delinquency  trends and  historical  charge-off  and recovery
activity.  No reserve has been made for Farmer Mac I Securities  issued prior to
the 1996 Act or securities  issued under the Farmer Mac II Program  ("Farmer Mac
II  Securities").  Farmer  Mac I  Securities  issued  prior  to the 1996 Act are
supported by unguaranteed  subordinated interests,  which are expected to exceed
the  estimated   credit  losses  on  those   securities.   Guaranteed   Portions
collateralizing  Farmer Mac II  Securities  are  guaranteed by the United States
Department of Agriculture ("USDA").

               (e)  Earnings Per Share

     Basic earnings per share are based on the weighted-average number of common
shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share are based on the weighted-average
number of common shares outstanding adjusted to include all potentially dilutive
common stock. The following  schedule  reconciles basic and diluted earnings per
share for the three months ended March 31, 2002 and 2001:

</TABLE>

               (f)  Reclassifications

     Certain  reclassifications of prior period information were made to conform
to the current period presentation.

               (g)  New Accounting Standards

     In April 2002,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board (FASB)  issued
Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  145,  Rescission  of  FASB
Statements  No. 4, 44 and 64,  Amendment of FASB  Statement No. 13 and Technical
Corrections ("SFAS 145"). Effective January 1, 2003, SFAS No. 145 requires gains
and losses from the  extinguishment  or  repurchase  of debt to be classified as
extraordinary  items only if they meet the criteria for such  classification  in
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30, Reporting the Results of Operations,
Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business and  Extraordinary,
Unusual and Infrequently  Occurring  Events and  Transactions  ("APB 30"). Until
January 1, 2003, gains and losses from the  extinguishment or repurchase of debt
must be classified  as  extraordinary  items.  After January 1, 2003 any gain or
loss resulting from the  extinguishment  or repurchase of debt  classified as an
extraordinary  item in a prior  period that does not meet the  criteria for such
classification under APB 30 must be reclassified.

Note 2.  Off-Balance Sheet Guaranteed Securities

     For  information  regarding the  off-balance  sheet risks  associated  with
Farmer Mac's  guarantees of AMBS and LTSPCs,  see  "Management's  Discussion and
Analysis of Financial  Condition and Results of  Operations - Risk  Management -
Credit Risk."

Note 3.  Comprehensive Income

     Comprehensive  income  (loss) is comprised of net income plus other changes
in  stockholders'  equity not resulting from  investments by or distributions to
stockholders. The following table sets forth comprehensive income (loss) for the
three months ended March 31, 2002 and 2001.  The changes in unrealized  gains on
securities  available-for-sale  are net of the related  deferred  tax benefit of
$4.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2002, and deferred tax benefit
of $4.6 million for the three  months  ended March 31, 2001.  The changes in the
fair value of financial  derivatives  classified  as cash flow hedges are net of
the related  deferred  tax expense of $1.7  million for the three  months  ended
March 31,  2002,  and  deferred tax benefit of $6.7 million for the three months
ended March 31, 2001.

     Certain statements made in this Form 10-Q are "forward-looking  statements"
within  the  meaning of the  Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform Act of 1995
pertaining  to  management's  current  expectations  as to Farmer  Mac's  future
financial results, business prospects and business developments. Forward-looking
statements  include,  without  limitation,   any  statement  that  may  predict,
forecast,  indicate or imply future results,  performance or  achievements,  and
typically are accompanied by, and identified with, such terms as  "anticipates,"
"believes,"  "expects,"  "intends," "should" and similar phrases.  The following
management's  discussion  and  analysis  includes   forward-looking   statements
addressing  Farmer Mac's  prospects  for  earnings and growth in loan  purchase,
guarantee and securitization volume; trends in net interest income and provision
for  losses;  changes in capital  position;  and other  business  and  financial
matters.

     Management's  expectations  for Farmer Mac's future  necessarily  involve a
number of assumptions,  estimates and the evaluation of risks and uncertainties.
Various  factors  could cause Farmer  Mac's  actual  results or events to differ
materially from the expectations as expressed or implied by the  forward-looking
statements,  including:  uncertainties  regarding  the  rate  and  direction  of
development  of the  secondary  market  for  agricultural  mortgage  loans;  the
possible  establishment  of  additional  statutory  or  regulatory  restrictions
applicable  to Farmer  Mac,  such as  restrictions  on Farmer  Mac's  investment
authority;  substantial  changes in interest  rates,  agricultural  land values,
commodity prices,  export demand for U.S.  agricultural products and the general
economy;  protracted  adverse  weather,  market  or other  conditions  affecting
particular geographic regions or particular  commodities related to agricultural
mortgage  loans  backing  Farmer  Mac  Guaranteed  Securities;   legislative  or
regulatory  developments or  interpretations  of Farmer Mac's statutory  charter
that could  adversely  affect  Farmer Mac or the  ability of certain  lenders to
participate  in  its  programs  or the  terms  of any  such  participation;  the
availability of debt funding in sufficient  quantities and at favorable rates to
support  continued  growth;   the  rate  of  growth  in  agricultural   mortgage
indebtedness; the size of the agricultural mortgage market; borrower preferences
for fixed-rate agricultural mortgage indebtedness; the willingness of lenders to
sell  agricultural  mortgage  loans into the Farmer Mac  secondary  market;  the
willingness of investors to invest in agricultural  mortgage-backed  securities;
competition in the  origination or purchase of  agricultural  mortgage loans and
the sale of agricultural mortgage-backed and debt securities; the effects on the
agricultural  economy of the  government  payments  that are provided for in the
farm bill signed  into law May 13, 2002;  or changes in Farmer Mac's status as a
government-sponsored enterprise.

     The foregoing factors are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report may
include additional factors that could adversely affect Farmer Mac's business and
its financial  performance.  Furthermore,  new risk factors  emerge from time to
time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor
assess the  effects of such  factors on Farmer  Mac's  business or the extent to
which any factor, or combination of factors,  may cause actual results to differ
materially  from the  expectations  expressed or implied by the  forward-looking
statements.  In light of  these  potential  risks  and  uncertainties,  no undue
reliance should be placed on any  forward-looking  statements  expressed in this
report. Furthermore, Farmer Mac undertakes no obligation to release publicly the
results  of  revisions  to any  forward-looking  statements  that may be made to
reflect any future events or circumstances.

Results of Operations

     Operating  Results.  SFAS 133  requires  the  change in the fair  values of
certain financial derivatives to be reflected in the Corporation's net income or
other  comprehensive  income.  Management  believes  that  reporting  results by
reference to operating income and operating  revenues,  excluding the cumulative
effect of the  change in  accounting  principles  recognized  on January 1, 2001
under SFAS 133 and its ongoing  effects during the reporting  periods,  provides
meaningful  operating  measures  of Farmer  Mac's  financial  performance.  Such
information is presented to supplement,  not replace, net income, revenues, cash
from  operations,  or any other  operating  or  liquidity  performance  measures
prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

</TABLE>


     Overview.  Net income for first quarter 2002,  including the cumulative and
ongoing  effects of SFAS 133 during the  quarter and the  extraordinary  gain on
debt extinguishment, was $7.2 million or $0.59 per diluted share. Net income for
first  quarter  2001 was $2.2  million  or $0.18 per  share.  Operating  income,
excluding the extraordinary  gain,  totaled $5.3 million for first quarter 2002,
or $0.44 per share,  compared  to $3.2  million,  or $0.27 per share,  for first
quarter 2001.

     Farmer Mac's revenue growth continued in first quarter 2002, reflecting the
effects of outstanding  guarantee volume as of March 31, 2002 that was more than
$1.2 billion  higher than at the close of first  quarter 2001 and  increased net
interest  income due to a higher average net interest yield on  interest-earning
assets.  During first  quarter 2002,  Farmer Mac (1) purchased  $39.2 million of
guaranteed portions of loans guaranteed by the USDA, (2) purchased $74.9 million
of Farmer Mac I loans and (3) added $338.8 million in long-term standby purchase
commitments.

     USDA is forecasting  net cash income on farms for 2002 to be $50.9 billion,
which includes an assumption for government payments of $10.7 billion.  However,
the  USDA's  current  government   payments  assumption  is  based  on  existing
legislation and does not take into account increases  contained in the farm bill
signed into law May 13, 2002 or any emergency  assistance  that may be contained
in any special legislation. In 2001, emergency assistance comprised $9.1 billion
of the $21 billion in government  payments made to the  agricultural  sector and
net cash income on farms for 2001 was $59.5 billion. USDA currently expects farm
real estate  values to rise during 2002 by about one percent.  Regionally,  farm
real estate values may vary with differing rates of increase,  or even decrease,
depending on commodities grown and regional economic factors.

     Set forth below is a more  detailed  discussion  of Farmer Mac's results of
operations.

     Net Interest Income. Net interest income was $7.5 million for first quarter
2002 compared to $5.5 million for first  quarter  2001.  The strength in the net
interest  yield is a result of continued  emphasis on sound  interest-rate  risk
management and debt issuance  strategies and a $609,000 (7 basis points) benefit
from  the  income   recognition  of  yield  maintenance   payments  received  in
conjunction  with borrower  prepayments  during first  quarter 2002.  The income
realized from yield maintenance  payments is, in effect, the accelerated present
value of an expected  future  income stream  which,  in turn,  leads to slightly
reduced net interest income in future reporting periods.  The timing and size of
these payments varies greatly and, as such,  variations should not be considered
indicative of positive or negative trends to gauge future financial results. The
following table provides information regarding the average balances and rates of
interest-earning  assets and funding for the three  months  ended March 31, 2002
and 2001.

     Other Income.  Other income, which is comprised of guarantee fee income and
miscellaneous  income,  totaled $5.0 million for first  quarter 2002 compared to
$3.6  million for the same  period in 2001.  Guarantee  fee income,  the largest
component of other income, was $4.6 million for first quarter 2002,  compared to
$3.4 million for first  quarter  2001.  The relative  increase in guarantee  fee
income  reflects an increase in the average  balance of outstanding  guarantees.
Miscellaneous  income was $391,000 for first quarter 2002,  compared to $166,000
for first quarter 2001.

     Expenses.  During  first  quarter  2002,  operating  expenses  totaled $2.5
million,  compared to $2.6 million for first quarter 2001. Operating expenses as
a  percentage  of operating  revenues  were 21 percent for first  quarter  2002,
compared to 29 percent for first quarter 2001.

     Farmer Mac's  provision for principal and interest  losses was $2.0 million
for first  quarter 2002 compared to $1.4 million for the same period in 2001. As
of March 31, 2002,  Farmer Mac's reserve for losses  totaled $17.0  million,  or
0.45  percent of  outstanding  post-1996  Act loans and AMBS,  compared to $12.4
million, or 0.49 percent, as of March 31, 2001.

     The  provision for income taxes totaled $2.5 million for first quarter 2002
compared to $1.6 million for the same period in 2001. Farmer Mac's effective tax
rate for first quarter 2002 was 31.0 percent  compared to 35.5 percent for 2001.
The  reduction  in the  effective  tax rate  reflects  the  effects  of  certain
tax-advantaged investment securities.

     Extraordinary  Gain.  During first quarter 2002 Farmer Mac recognized a net
after-tax  extraordinary  gain of $1.6 million  resulting from the repurchase of
$43.8 million of outstanding Farmer Mac debt.

     Business  Volume.  The  following  table  sets  forth  the  amount of loans

     See  "Overview"  above  for a  discussion  regarding  loans  purchased  and
guaranteed by Farmer Mac.

     Indicators of future loan purchase and guarantee  volume (but not of LTSPC,
swap or bulk purchase  volume) in the immediately  succeeding  reporting  period
include outstanding commitments to purchase loans and the total balance of loans
submitted  for  approval  or  approved  but not  yet  purchased.  Many  purchase
commitments entered into by Farmer Mac are mandatory delivery commitments.  If a
seller  obtains a  mandatory  commitment  and is unable to deliver  the loans as
required  thereunder,  Farmer  Mac  requires  the seller to pay a fee to modify,
extend or cancel the commitment.  As of March 31, 2002, outstanding  commitments
to purchase Farmer Mac I loans totaled $18.6 million,  compared to $18.4 million
as of March 31, 2001.  Of the total Farmer Mac I commitments  outstanding  as of
March 31, 2002 and 2001,  $4.3  million  and $7.9  million,  respectively,  were
mandatory  commitments.  Loans  submitted  for  approval or approved but not yet
committed to purchase  totaled $82.9  million as of March 31, 2002,  compared to
$133.7 million as of March 31, 2001.  Not all of these loans are  purchased,  as
some are denied for credit reasons or withdrawn by the seller.

     While significant progress has been made in developing the secondary market
for  agricultural  mortgages,  Farmer Mac  continues to face the  challenges  of
establishing a market where none previously existed.  Acceptance of Farmer Mac's
programs is increasing among lenders,  reflecting the competitive  rates,  terms
and  products  offered  and the  advantages  Farmer Mac  believes  its  programs
provide.  For Farmer Mac to succeed in realizing  its business  development  and
profitability  objectives over the longer term, the use of Farmer Mac's programs
and  products  by  agricultural   mortgage  lenders,   whether   traditional  or
non-traditional, must continue to expand.

Balance Sheet Review

     During the three month period ended March 31, 2002,  total assets decreased
by $3.2  million,  with  increases  in program  assets  (Farmer  Mac  guaranteed
securities  and loans) of $36.6  million  being more than offset by decreases in
non-program  and other assets.  For further  information  regarding both on- and
off-balance sheet guaranteed securities,  see "Supplemental  Information" below.
Similar to the decrease in total  assets  during the period,  total  liabilities
decreased by $6.2 million from December 31, 2001 to March 31, 2002.

     Average  return on equity,  excluding the effects of Statement of Financial
Accounting  Standards No. 115,  Accounting  for Certain  Investments in Debt and
Equity  Securities,  SFAS 133 and the  extraordinary  item, was 16.4 percent for
first quarter 2002, compared to 12.3 percent for first quarter 2001.

     As of March 31, 2002,  Farmer Mac's  statutory core capital  totaled $134.0
million,  compared to $126.0  million as of December 31,  2001.  As of March 31,
2002, the statutory core capital balance exceeded Farmer Mac's statutory minimum
capital requirement by approximately $21.8 million.

     On April 12, 2001, the Farm Credit Administration  ("FCA") issued its final
risk-based capital regulation for Farmer Mac. The regulation requires Farmer Mac
to meet the risk-based  capital  standards by May 23, 2002. We have maintained a
dialogue with FCA regarding the  application  of the  regulation and the complex
underlying  economic model - particularly  certain provisions that suggest to us
that the FCA went outside the authorizing  statute.  If no change is made to the
regulation,  at some time in the  future  it could  lead to an  increase  in the
capital  requirement  for certain newly  guaranteed  program assets and so cause
Farmer Mac to alter its  strategic  plan for future  growth.  We believe at this
time that the regulation,  as issued, would not cause us to alter that strategic
plan  materially and we are confident that Farmer Mac will be in compliance when
required to meet the  standard.  As of the end of first  quarter  2002,  had the
regulation been effective,  the required risk-based capital for Farmer Mac would
have been $32.3 million,  significantly below our minimum capital requirement of
$112.2 million.

Risk Management

     Interest-Rate  Risk.  Farmer Mac is subject  to  interest-rate  risk on all
assets held for investment  because of possible  timing  differences in the cash
flows of the assets and related  liabilities.  This risk is primarily related to
Farmer Mac I and II  Securities  because of the ability of  borrowers  to prepay
their mortgages before the scheduled maturities,  thereby increasing the risk of
asset and liability  cash flow  mismatches.  Farmer Mac's  primary  strategy for
managing  interest-rate risk related to Farmer Mac I and II Securities and other
assets held for  investment is to fund them with  liabilities  that have similar
durations,  or average cash flow patterns over time, and provide  flexibility to
accommodate changing prepayment rates in changing interest rate environments. To
achieve  the  desired  funding  objective,  Farmer Mac uses a mix of  short-term
Discount Notes,  interest-rate  swaps and callable and non-callable  Medium-Term
Notes. By using a mix of liabilities  that includes  callable debt, the duration
of the liabilities will tend to increase or decrease as interest rates change in
a manner similar to changes in the duration of the assets (the rate of change in
the duration of an asset or liability to a change in interest  rates is referred
to as convexity).

     One method Farmer Mac uses to monitor its exposure to interest-rate risk is
to measure the sensitivity of its market value of equity ("MVE") to an immediate
and instantaneous parallel shift of the U.S. Treasury yield curve. The following
schedule  summarizes the results of Farmer Mac's MVE sensitivity  analysis as of
March 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001.

     Farmer Mac assumes 100 percent of the credit risk on  post-1996  Act Farmer
Mac I loans;  pre-1996 Act Farmer Mac I loans back securities that are supported
by mandatory 10 percent first loss  subordinated  interests that mitigate credit
exposure; Farmer Mac II loans are guaranteed by the USDA. Farmer Mac believes it
has little or no credit risk exposure to pre-1996 Act Farmer Mac I loans because
of the first loss subordinated  interests related to pools of those loans, or to
Farmer Mac II loans because of the USDA guarantee.

     As of March 31, 2002, post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I loans that were 90 days or
more past due, in foreclosure or in bankruptcy  represented  2.32 percent of the
outstanding  principal balance of all post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I loans, compared
to 2.62  percent as of March 31, 2001 and 1.70  percent as of December 31, 2001.
Farmer Mac  anticipates  fluctuations  in the  delinquency  rate from quarter to
quarter,  with higher levels likely as of March 31 and September 30 of each year
due to the semi-annual payment characteristics of most Farmer Mac loans.

     The  following  table  shows  Farmer  Mac I  delinquencies  distributed  by
post-1996 Act loans and pre-1996 Act loans.

     Farmer Mac  maintains a reserve to cover losses on post-1996 Act Farmer Mac
I loans.  Based on Farmer  Mac's loan  collection  experience,  the value of the
collateral  securing  the loans and  continuing  provisions  for the reserve for
losses,  Farmer Mac believes that ongoing charge-offs will be covered adequately
by the reserve for losses.  Farmer Mac expects  quarterly  charge-offs  for loan
losses to continue at their current level of approximately  $850,000 per quarter
for the next several  quarters.  In certain  collateral  liquidation  scenarios,
Farmer Mac may recover amounts  previously  written off if liquidation  proceeds
exceed previous estimates.  As of March 31, 2002, the weighted-average  original
loan-to-value  ratio for all  post-1996  Act loans was 49 percent.  Farmer Mac's
provision for  principal and interest  losses was $2.0 million for first quarter
2002,  compared to $2.0  million for fourth  quarter  2001 and $1.4  million for
first  quarter  2001.  As of March 31,  2002,  Farmer  Mac's  reserve for losses
totaled $17.0 million, or 45 basis points of the outstanding post-1996 Act loans
and AMBS,  compared to $15.9  million (45 basis  points) as of December 31, 2001
and $12.4 million (49 basis points) as of March 31, 2001.
