Item 1. Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

     The following interim condensed  consolidated  financial  statements of the
Federal  Agricultural  Mortgage  Corporation ("Farmer Mac" or the "Corporation")
have been prepared,  without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the
Securities  and  Exchange  Commission.   These  interim  condensed  consolidated
financial  statements reflect all normal and recurring  adjustments that are, in
the  opinion  of  management,  necessary  to  present  a fair  statement  of the
financial  condition and the results of operations  and cash flows of Farmer Mac
for the interim periods presented.  Certain information and footnote disclosures
normally  included  in  annual  consolidated   financial  statements  have  been
condensed  or omitted as  permitted  by such rules and  regulations.  Management
believes  that the  disclosures  are  adequate to present  fairly the  condensed
consolidated  financial position,  condensed  consolidated results of operations
and  condensed  consolidated  cash  flows as of the  dates  and for the  periods
presented.  These condensed  consolidated financial statements should be read in
conjunction with the audited 2003  consolidated  financial  statements of Farmer
Mac included in the Corporation's  Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended

Note 1.  Accounting Policies

(a)   Cash and Cash Equivalents

     Farmer Mac considers  highly liquid  investment  securities  with remaining
maturities  of  three  months  or  less  at the  time  of  purchase  to be  cash
equivalents. Changes in the balance of cash and cash equivalents are reported in
the Condensed  Consolidated  Statements of Cash Flows.  The following table sets
forth information  regarding certain cash and non-cash transactions for the nine
months ended September 30, 2004 and 2003.

</TABLE>

          (b)  Allowance for Losses

     As of September 30, 2004,  Farmer Mac maintained a $22.5 million  allowance
and contingent  obligation for probable losses ("allowance for losses") to cover
estimated  probable losses on loans held for investment,  real estate owned, and
loans underlying post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities and long-term
standby  purchase  commitments   ("LTSPCs")  in  accordance  with  Statement  of
Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies  ("SFAS 5")
and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 114, Accounting by Creditors
for  Impairment  of a  Loan,  as  amended  ("SFAS  114").  The  methodology  for
determining  the allowance for losses is the same for loans held for  investment
and loans underlying post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs
because Farmer Mac believes the ultimate credit risk is substantially  the same,
i.e.,  the  underlying  agricultural  mortgage  loans  all meet the same  credit
underwriting and appraisal standards.

     The allowance for losses is increased through periodic  provisions for loan
losses that are charged  against net interest  income and  provisions for losses
that are charged to operating  expense and is reduced by charge-offs  for actual
losses,  net of  recoveries.  Charge-offs  represent  losses on the  outstanding
principal  balance,  any  interest  payment  previously  accrued or advanced and
expected costs of liquidation.

     The table below  summarizes  the  components of Farmer Mac's  allowance for
losses,  which includes its contingent  obligation  for probable  losses,  as of
September 30, 2004 and December 31, 2003.

     No  allowance  for losses has been made for loans  underlying  Farmer Mac I
Guaranteed  Securities issued prior to the Farm Credit System Reform Act of 1996
(the "1996 Act") or securities  issued under the Farmer Mac II program  ("Farmer
Mac II Guaranteed Securities").  Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities issued prior
to the 1996 Act are supported by unguaranteed first loss subordinated interests,
which are structured to exceed the estimated  credit losses on those loans.  The
guaranteed portions of loans collateralizing Farmer Mac II Guaranteed Securities
are  guaranteed by the United States  Department of Agriculture  ("USDA").  Each
USDA  guarantee  is an  obligation  backed by the full  faith and  credit of the
United  States.  To date,  Farmer Mac has  experienced  no credit  losses on any
pre-1996  Act  Farmer  Mac I  Guaranteed  Securities  or on  any  Farmer  Mac II
Guaranteed  Securities  and does not  expect  to incur  any such  losses  in the
future.

          (c)  Financial Derivatives

     Farmer Mac enters into  financial  derivative  transactions  principally to
protect against risk from the effects of market price or interest rate movements
on the value of certain assets and future cash flows or debt  issuance,  not for
trading or  speculative  purposes.  Farmer Mac enters  into  interest  rate swap
contracts  principally to adjust the  characteristics  of its short-term debt to
match more closely the cash flow and duration characteristics of its longer-term
mortgage  and  other  assets,  and also to  adjust  the  characteristics  of its
long-term debt to match more closely the cash flow and duration  characteristics
of  its  short-term   assets,   thereby  reducing   interest  rate  risk.  These
transactions  also may provide an overall lower effective cost of borrowing than
would otherwise be available in the conventional debt market.

     All financial  derivatives  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value
as  a  freestanding  asset  or  liability.   Financial  derivatives  in  hedging
relationships  that mitigate exposure to changes in the fair value of assets are
considered  fair value hedges.  Financial  derivatives in hedging  relationships
that mitigate the exposure to the  variability in expected  future cash flows or
other  forecasted  transactions  are  considered  cash  flow  hedges.  Financial
derivatives  that do not satisfy the hedging  criteria of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative  Instruments and Hedging
Activities, as amended ("SFAS 133") are not accounted for as hedges, and changes
in the fair  values of those  financial  derivatives  are  reported  as gains or
losses on financial derivatives and trading assets in the condensed consolidated
statements of operations.

     The  following  table  summarizes   information  related  to  Farmer  Mac's
financial derivatives as of September 30, 2004 and December 31, 2003:

</TABLE>

     As of September 30, 2004, Farmer Mac had approximately $41.6 million of net
after-tax  unrealized  losses on cash flow hedges included in accumulated  other
comprehensive income/(loss). These amounts will be reclassified into earnings in
the same  period or  periods  during  which the hedged  forecasted  transactions
(either  the payment of interest  or the  issuance  of  discount  notes)  affect
earnings  or  immediately  when it becomes  probable  that the  original  hedged
forecasted  transaction  will not occur  within  two  months  of the  originally
specified  date.  Over the next twelve  months,  Farmer Mac estimates  that $7.4
million of the amount  currently  reported in  accumulated  other  comprehensive
income/(loss)  will  be  reclassified  into  earnings.  For  the  quarter  ended
September  30, 2004,  any  ineffectiveness  related to Farmer  Mac's  designated
hedges was insignificant.

          (d)  Earnings Per Common Share

     Basic earnings per common share are based on the weighted-average number of
common shares  outstanding.  Diluted  earnings per common share are based on the
weighted-average  number of common  shares  outstanding  adjusted to include all
potentially  dilutive common stock options.  The following  schedule  reconciles
basic and diluted  earnings per common share for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2004 and 2003:

</TABLE>

     During third quarter 2004, Farmer Mac common stock repurchases  reduced the
Corporation's  capital by  approximately  $1.4 million.  Farmer Mac  repurchased
70,951  shares of its Class C Non-Voting  Common  Stock,  at an average price of
$19.88 per share,  pursuant  to the  Corporation's  previously  announced  stock
repurchase program.

          (e)  Stock-Based Compensation

     Farmer Mac accounts for its stock-based  employee  compensation plans using
the intrinsic value method of accounting for employee stock options  pursuant to
Accounting  Principles  Board  Opinion No. 25,  Accounting  for Stock  Issued to
Employees,  and has adopted  the  disclosure-only  provisions  of  Statement  of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,
as amended ("SFAS 123"). Accordingly,  no compensation expense was recognized in
third quarter 2004 or third quarter 2003 for employee stock options.  Had Farmer
Mac  elected to use the fair  value  method of  accounting  for  employee  stock
options,  net income available to common stockholders and earnings per share for
the three and nine  months  ended  September  30,  2004 and 2003 would have been
reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated in the following table:

     Certain  reclassifications of prior period information were made to conform
to the current period presentation.

          (g)  New Accounting Standards


     In March 2004, the Emerging  Issues Task Force ("EITF")  amended EITF 03-1,
The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary  Impairment, to introduce a three-step model
to: (1) determine  whether an investment is impaired;  (2) evaluate  whether the
impairment  is  other-than-temporary;  and (3) account for  other-than-temporary
impairments. In part, this amendment requires companies to apply qualitative and
quantitative  measures  to  determine  whether a decline  in the fair value of a
security is  other-than-temporary.  The guidance in EITF 03-1 is  effective  for
reporting  periods  beginning after June 15, 2004, with the exception of certain
sections,  which have been  deferred.  Farmer Mac has the intent and  ability to
hold to recovery any securities that may fall under the scope of this amendment.
Farmer Mac is  evaluating  the impact of the  amendment,  and will adopt it when
effective in full.

     On January 1, 2003, Farmer Mac adopted the liability recognition provisions
of the Financial  Accounting  Standards Board Interpretation No. 45, Guarantor's
Accounting  and  Disclosure  Requirements  for  Guarantees,  Including  Indirect
Guarantees of  Indebtedness  of Others ("FIN 45"),  which requires Farmer Mac to
recognize,  at the  inception of a guarantee,  a liability for the fair value of
its  obligation  to stand  ready to  perform  under the terms of each  guarantee
agreement  and an asset that is equal to the fair value of the fees that will be
received over the life of each  guarantee.  In December 2003, the Securities and
Exchange Commission provided additional guidance on the "day two" accounting for
these financial  instruments.  In accordance with this guidance,  Farmer Mac has
adopted the amortized cost model for day two accounting  prospectively effective
January 1, 2004.

Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities as of September 30, 2004.

Fair value of beneficial interests retained
    in Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities           $ 1,358,105

Weighted-average remaining life (in years)                5.0

Weighted-average prepayment speed (annual rate)           8.8%
    Effect on fair value of a 10% adverse change       $ (417)
    Effect on fair value of a 20% adverse change       $ (796)

Weighted-average discount rate                          4.9%
    Effect on fair value of a 10% adverse change    $ (18,506)
    Effect on fair value of a 20% adverse change    $ (36,996)
</TABLE>



     These sensitivities are hypothetical.  As the figures indicate,  changes in
fair value based on 10 percent or 20 percent variations in assumptions generally
cannot be extrapolated  because the relationship of the change in assumptions to
the change in fair value may not be linear.  Also, in this table the effect of a
variation in a particular  assumption on the fair value of the retained interest
is calculated  without changing any other  assumption.  In fact,  changes in one
factor  may  result in changes in  another  (for  example,  increases  in market
interest  rates  may  result  in lower  prepayments),  which  might  amplify  or
counteract the sensitivities.

Note 3.  Off-Balance Sheet Guarantees and Long-Term Standby Purchase
         Commitments

Overview

     Farmer Mac offers  approved  agricultural  and rural  residential  mortgage
lenders two  off-balance  sheet  alternatives  to increase  their  liquidity  or
lending  capacity  while  retaining the cash flow  benefits of their loans:  (1)
Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities,  which are available through either the Farmer
Mac I program or the Farmer Mac II program,  and (2) LTSPCs, which are available
only  through  the Farmer Mac I program.  Both of these  alternatives  result in
off-balance sheet transactions for Farmer Mac.


Off-Balance Sheet Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities

     Periodically Farmer Mac transfers  agricultural  mortgage loans into trusts
that are used as vehicles for the  securitization of the transferred  assets and
the beneficial  interests in the trusts are sold to third party  investors.  The
table  below  summarizes  certain  cash  flows  received  from and paid to these
trusts.

</TABLE>

     As of September 30, 2004, the  weighted-average  remaining  maturity of all
loans  underlying  off-balance  sheet Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities was 15.0
years.  For the off-balance  sheet Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities that were
executed on or before  December 31,  2002,  Farmer Mac has recorded an allowance
for probable losses of $1.3 million as of September 30, 2004 and $1.1 million as
of December 31, 2003.  For those  securities  that were issued or modified on or
after  January 1, 2003,  Farmer Mac has  recorded  the fair value of its initial
obligation  to stand ready under the  guarantee as a liability.  This  liability
approximated  $5.1  million  as of  September  30,  2004 and $4.1  million as of
December 31, 2003 and is reported in the guarantee and commitment  obligation on
the condensed consolidated balance sheet.

Long-Term Standby Purchase Commitments (LTSPCs)

     An LTSPC is a commitment by Farmer Mac to purchase  eligible loans,  either
for cash or in exchange for Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities,  on one or more
undetermined future dates.

     As of  September  30, 2004 and December  31,  2003,  the maximum  principal
amount of  potential  undiscounted  future  payments  that  Farmer  Mac could be
requested to make under LTSPCs,  not including  offsets provided by any recourse
provisions,  recoveries  from third  parties or  collateral  for the  underlying
loans,  was  $2.4  billion  and  $2.3  billion,   respectively.  For  all  LTSPC
transactions to date, Farmer Mac has incurred a charge-off on two loans.

     As of September 30, 2004, the  weighted-average  remaining  maturity of all
loans underlying  LTSPCs was 14.6 years. For the LTSPCs that were executed on or
before  December  31, 2002,  Farmer Mac has  recorded an allowance  for probable
losses of $10.6 million as of September 30, 2004 and $9.2 million as of December
31, 2003.  For those LTSPCs that were issued or modified on or after  January 1,
2003, Farmer Mac has recorded the fair value of its initial  obligation to stand
ready under the  commitment as a liability.  This  liability  approximated  $9.9
million as of  September  30, 2004 and $7.3  million as of December 31, 2003 and
was  included  in the  guarantee  and  commitment  obligation  on the  condensed
consolidated balance sheet.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
        Results of Operations

     Please read the following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition  and Results of  Operations  in  conjunction  with:  (1) the condensed
consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in
this report; and (2) Farmer Mac's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2003.

Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

     Certain  statements  made in this report are  "forward-looking  statements"
within  the  meaning of the  Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform Act of 1995
pertaining  to  management's  current  expectations  as to Farmer  Mac's  future
financial results, business prospects and business developments. Forward-looking
statements  include,  without  limitation,   any  statement  that  may  predict,
forecast,  indicate or imply future results,  performance or  achievements,  and
typically are accompanied by, and identified with, such terms as  "anticipates,"
"believes,"  "expects,"  "intends," "should" and similar phrases.  The following
management's  discussion  and  analysis  includes   forward-looking   statements
addressing Farmer Mac's:

          o    prospects for earnings;
          o    growth in loan  purchase,  guarantee,  LTSPC  and  securitization
               volume;
          o    trends in net interest income;
          o    trends in provisions for losses;
          o    trends in expenses;
          o    changes in capital position; and
          o    other business and financial matters.

     Management's  expectations  for Farmer Mac's future  necessarily  involve a
number  of   assumptions   and  estimates  and  the   evaluation  of  risks  and
uncertainties. Various factors could cause Farmer Mac's actual results or events
to differ  materially  from the  expectations  as  expressed  or  implied by the
forward-looking statements, including uncertainties regarding:

          o    the rate and direction of development of the secondary market for
               agricultural mortgage loans;
          o    the possible  establishment of additional statutory or regulatory
               restrictions  or  constraints on Farmer Mac that could hamper its
               growth or diminish its profitability;
          o    legislative  or regulatory  developments  or  interpretations  of
               Farmer Mac's statutory charter that could adversely affect Farmer
               Mac  or  the  ability  or  motivation   of  certain   lenders  to
               participate   in  its   programs   or  the   terms  of  any  such
               participation,  or increase  the cost of  regulation  and related
               corporate activities;
          o    possible  reaction in the financial  markets to events  involving
               government-sponsored enterprises other than Farmer Mac;
          o    Farmer Mac's  access to the debt  markets at favorable  rates and
               terms;
          o    the possible effect of the risk-based capital requirement,  which
               could, under certain circumstances, be in excess of the statutory
               minimum capital requirement;
          o    the rate of growth in agricultural mortgage indebtedness;
          o    lender  interest in Farmer Mac credit products and the Farmer Mac
               secondary market;
          o    borrower   preferences  for  fixed-rate   agricultural   mortgage
               indebtedness;
          o    competitive  pressures in the purchase of  agricultural  mortgage
               loans and the sale of agricultural mortgage-backed securities and
               debt securities;
          o    substantial changes in interest rates,  agricultural land values,
               commodity prices,  export demand for U.S.  agricultural  products
               and the general economy;
          o    protracted adverse weather,  market or other conditions affecting
               particular  geographic regions or particular  commodities related
               to  agricultural  mortgage  loans backing Farmer Mac I Guaranteed
               Securities or under LTSPCs;
          o    the   willingness   of  investors   to  invest  in   agricultural
               mortgage-backed securities; or
          o    the  effects  on  the  agricultural   economy  or  the  value  of
               agricultural real estate of any changes in federal assistance for
               agriculture.

     The foregoing factors are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report may
include additional factors that could adversely affect Farmer Mac's business and
its financial  performance.  Furthermore,  new risk factors  emerge from time to
time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor
assess the  effects of such  factors on Farmer  Mac's  business or the extent to
which any factor, or combination of factors,  may cause actual results to differ
materially  from the  expectations  expressed or implied by the  forward-looking
statements.  In light of  these  potential  risks  and  uncertainties,  no undue
reliance should be placed on any  forward-looking  statements  expressed in this
report. Furthermore, Farmer Mac undertakes no obligation to release publicly the
results  of  revisions  to any  forward-looking  statements  that may be made to
reflect any future events or circumstances,  except as otherwise mandated by the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

Critical Accounting Policy and Estimates

     The critical  accounting  policy that is both important to the portrayal of
Farmer Mac's financial condition and results of operations and requires complex,
subjective  judgments is the accounting policy for the allowance for losses. For
a discussion of Farmer Mac's critical accounting policy, as well as Farmer Mac's
use of  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect the  amounts  reported  in the
condensed  consolidated  financial  statements and related notes for the periods
presented,  see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results  of  Operations--Critical   Accounting  Policy  and  Estimates"  in  the
Corporation's  Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended  December 31, 2003,
filed with the SEC on March 15, 2004.

Results of Operations

     Overview.  Net income  available to common  stockholders  for third quarter
2004 was $8.6  million  or $0.70 per  diluted  common  share,  compared  to $3.3
million or $0.28 per diluted common share for third quarter 2003.  This increase
was due  principally to the increase in the fair value of financial  derivatives
as accounted for in accordance with SFAS 133, as explained  below.  During third
quarter 2004, Farmer Mac:

          o    added $84.1 million of Farmer Mac I eligible loans under LTSPCs;
          o    purchased $23.2 million of newly originated Farmer Mac I eligible
               loans; and
          o    purchased $49.8 million of Farmer Mac II eligible USDA-guaranteed
               portions of loans.

     As of September 30, 2004, Farmer Mac's outstanding  program volume was $5.5
billion, which represented  approximately 12 percent of management's estimate of
a $44.5 billion market of eligible  agricultural  mortgage loans. For Farmer Mac
to succeed in realizing its business  development and  profitability  objectives
over  the  longer  term,  the use of  Farmer  Mac's  programs  and  products  by
agricultural  mortgage lenders,  whether  traditional or  non-traditional,  must
expand.

     Farmer Mac's  ongoing  guarantee  and  commitment  fee income  reflects the
annuity-like revenue stream of that aspect of the Corporation's  business.  That
fee income is earned on the cumulative  outstanding  principal balance of Farmer
Mac  Guaranteed  Securities  and  loans  underlying  LTSPCs.  Accordingly,  GAAP
earnings  increase or decrease  through  changes in periodic  business volume in
proportion to the change in that cumulative  outstanding  principal balance, not
in proportion to the change in periodic volume.

     As discussed below in Expenses, compensation and employee benefits, general
and  administrative  expenses,  and  regulatory  fees  for  third  quarter  2004
continued  their  upward  trends of prior  quarters.  This upward trend has been
generated  by  greater  staffing  levels and  consultants'  fees  necessary  for
increased corporate governance and regulatory compliance  activities,  including
requirements  of  the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act of  2002  and  FCA,  as  well  as the
heightened  focus  on  the  regulatory   environment  for   government-sponsored
enterprises  generally.  Farmer Mac expects its expenses and regulatory  fees to
continue at or above current levels through 2005.

     Farmer  Mac is  subject  to  interest  rate  risk on all  assets  held  for
investment  because  of  possible  timing  differences  in the cash flows of the
assets and related liabilities. This risk is primarily related to loans held and
on-balance  sheet  Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities  because of the ability of
borrowers to prepay their  mortgages  before the scheduled  maturities,  thereby
increasing  the  risk  of  asset  and  liability  cash  flow  mismatches.  Yield
maintenance   provisions  and  other  prepayment  penalties  contained  in  many
agricultural mortgage loans reduce, but do not eliminate,  this prepayment risk,
particularly in the case of a defaulted loan where yield  maintenance may not be
collected.

      Farmer Mac's primary exposure to credit risk is the risk of loss resulting
from the inability of borrowers to repay their mortgages in conjunction with a
deficiency in the value of the collateral relative to the amount outstanding on
the mortgage and the costs of liquidation. Farmer Mac has established
underwriting, appraisal and documentation standards for agricultural mortgage
loans to mitigate the risk of loss from borrower defaults and to provide
guidance concerning the management, administration and conduct of underwriting
and appraisals to all participating sellers and potential sellers in its
programs.

     Set forth below is a more  detailed  discussion  of Farmer Mac's results of
operations.

     Net Interest Income. Net interest income,  which does not include guarantee
fees for loans purchased prior to April 1, 2001 (the effective date of Statement
of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  140,  Accounting  for  Transfers  and
Servicing of Financial Assets and  Extinguishments of Liabilities ("SFAS 140")),
was $8.0 million for third  quarter  2004 and $25.3  million for the nine months
ended  September  30,  2004,   compared  to  $8.9  million  and  $28.2  million,
respectively,  for the same periods in 2003. The net interest yield was 86 basis
points for the nine months ended September 30, 2004, compared to 93 basis points
for the nine months ended September 30, 2003. The effect of the adoption of SFAS
140 was the  classification  of approximately  $3.2 million (11 basis points) of
guarantee fee income as interest  income for the nine months ended September 30,
2004,  compared  to $3.3  million (11 basis  points)  for the nine months  ended

     Farmer Mac  classifies  the net  interest  income and  expense  realized on
financial   derivatives   that  are  not  in  fair  value  or  cash  flow  hedge
relationships  as gains and losses on financial  derivatives and trading assets.
For the nine months ended  September  30, 2004 and 2003,  this  reclassification
resulted in the  decrease  of the net  interest  yield of 5 basis  points and an
increase of 1 basis point, respectively.

     The net interest  yields for the nine months ended  September  30, 2004 and
2003 included the benefits of yield  maintenance  payments  received of 14 basis
points and 12 basis points,  respectively.  Yield maintenance payments represent
the present value of expected  future interest income streams and accelerate the
recognition of interest  income from the related  loans.  Because the timing and
amounts of these  payments  vary  greatly,  variations  should not be considered
indicative of positive or negative trends to gauge future financial results. For
the nine  months  ended  September  30,  2004 and  2003,  the  effects  of yield
maintenance  payments  on net income and  diluted  earnings  per share were $2.7
million or $0.22 per diluted share and $2.4 million or $0.20 per diluted  share,
respectively.

     The following table provides information regarding the average balances and
rates of interest-earning assets and funding for the nine months ended September
30, 2004 and 2003. The balance of non-accruing  loans is included in the average
balance  of  interest-earning  loans  presented,  though  no  related  income is
included in the income  figures  presented.  The low average rate earned on cash
and cash equivalents reflects the low level of short-term rates in both periods,
with generally higher average  short-term rates during the 2004 period offset by
tighter  market  spreads.  The  decrease  in the  average  rate for  investments
reflects tighter market spreads on new floating rate investments acquired during
2004 and the  maturity of higher  yielding  investments  outstanding  during the
prior  period.  The  lower  average  rate on loans  and  Farmer  Mac  Guaranteed
Securities  reflects the paydown of older, higher yielding fixed rate loans. The
increase in the average rate for notes  payable due within one year reflects the
general increase in average  short-term rates during the 2004 period compared to
the 2003 period.  The  decrease in the average rate for notes  payable due after
one year reflects the retirement of older,  higher rate debt and the issuance of
new debt at lower rates.

</TABLE>

     See "--Regulatory  Matters" for actions by Farmer Mac's federal  regulator,
the Farm Credit  Administration  ("FCA"), that may potentially affect future net
interest income.

     Guarantee and  Commitment  Fees.  Guarantee and  commitment  fees were $5.3
million for third quarter 2004, compared to $5.1 million for third quarter 2003.
The  effects of the  adoption  of SFAS 140 were $1.0  million of  guarantee  fee
income  being  classified  as interest  income for third  quarter 2004 and third
quarter 2003,  although  management  considers the amount to have been earned in
consideration  for the assumption of credit risk. That portion of the difference
or  "spread"  between  the cost of Farmer  Mac's debt  funding for loans and the
yield on  post-1996  Act Farmer Mac I  Guaranteed  Securities  held on its books
compensates  for credit and interest  rate risk. If a post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I
Guaranteed  Security is sold to a third party,  Farmer Mac  continues to receive
the guarantee fee component of that spread, which continues to compensate Farmer
Mac  for  its  assumption  of  credit  risk.  The  portion  of the  spread  that
compensates  for interest rate risk would not typically  continue to be received
by Farmer Mac if the asset were sold,  except to the extent  attributable to any
retained interest-only strip.

     Other Income. Miscellaneous income was $0.7 million for third quarter 2004,
compared to $0.4  million for third  quarter  2003.  The increase was due to the
collection  of late fees.  During the nine  months  ended  September  30,  2004,
through a competitive bid process,  the  Corporation  sold Farmer Mac Guaranteed
Securities  in the amount of $26.9  million to a related  party in a transaction
that resulted in a $0.4 million gain on sale of Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities
in second  quarter 2004.  Also during the nine months ended  September 30, 2004,
Farmer Mac  received  $1.8  million from two sellers (one of which was a related
party) for breaches of  representations  and  warranties  associated  with prior
sales of agricultural  mortgage loans to Farmer Mac. This amount was reported as
miscellaneous  income in second quarter 2004. Farmer Mac had previously  charged
off these amounts as losses on the associated loans.

     Expenses.  Compensation  and employee  benefits for third quarter 2004 were
$1.7  million,  compared to $1.6  million for third  quarter  2003.  General and
administrative  expenses for third quarter 2004 were $2.0  million,  compared to
$1.6 million for third quarter 2003. The increases in compensation  and employee
benefits and general and  administrative  expenses  were due, in large part,  to
greater staffing levels and consultants' fees necessary for increased  corporate
governance and regulatory compliance  activities,  including requirements of the
Sarbanes-Oxley  Act of 2002  and  FCA,  as well as the  heightened  focus on the
regulatory   environment   for   government-sponsored   enterprises   generally.
Regulatory  fees  assessed  by FCA for  third  quarter  2004 and 2003  were $0.5
million and $0.4 million, respectively.  FCA's regulatory fees charged to Farmer
Mac for the federal fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 were $2.0 million,  and
FCA has advised the  Corporation  that its estimated fees for the federal fiscal
year ending September 30, 2005 will be $2.3 million.  After the end of a federal
government  fiscal year, FCA may revise its prior year estimated  assessments to
reflect actual costs incurred,  and has issued both  additional  assessments and
refunds in the past. Farmer Mac expects all of the above-mentioned  expenses and
regulatory fees to continue at or above current levels through 2005.

     Farmer Mac's net REO  operating  costs for third  quarter 2004  resulted in
income of $0.1 million.  For the nine months ended  September 30, 2004,  net REO
operating costs were $0.3 million. Net REO operating costs in prior periods were
nominal.

     Farmer Mac's total  provision for losses was $1.6 million for third quarter
2004, compared to $2.2 million for third quarter 2003. (See  "--Quantitative and
Qualitative   Disclosures  About  Market  Risk   Management--Credit   Risk"  for
additional information regarding Farmer Mac's provision for losses and provision
for loan  losses.) As of September  30, 2004,  Farmer Mac's total  allowance for
losses totaled $22.5 million, or 0.47 percent of outstanding loans held or loans
underlying post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs, compared
to $22.1  million (0.44 percent of  outstanding  loans held or loans  underlying
post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities and LTSPCs) as of December 31,
2003.

     Gains and Losses on Financial  Derivatives  and Trading  Assets.  For third
quarter  2004,  the gain on financial  derivatives  and trading  assets was $5.4
million,  compared to a loss of $3.3 million for third quarter 2003. The gain in
third quarter 2004 and the loss in third quarter 2003  resulted  primarily  from
fluctuations  in the  fair  values  of  financial  derivatives,  resulting  from
movements in interest rates,  that have not been designated in either fair value
or cash flow hedge relationships in accordance with SFAS 133.

     Non-GAAP Performance Measures.  Farmer Mac reports its financial results in
accordance with GAAP. In addition to GAAP measures,  Farmer Mac presents certain
non-GAAP  performance  measures.  Farmer  Mac uses  these  non-GAAP  performance
measures to develop financial plans, to measure corporate economic  performance,
and to set incentive  compensation.  In management's  view the non-GAAP measures
provide a more accurate  representation  of Farmer Mac's  economic  performance,
transaction  economics and business  trends.  Not all of Farmer Mac's  financial
derivatives  are  specifically  identified as hedges under SFAS 133. Thus,  GAAP
requires  Farmer Mac to apply a mixed attribute  accounting  model that does not
reflect the  economics  for those  transactions.  Investors  and the  investment
analyst  community  have  previously  relied upon  similar  measures to evaluate
performance and issue projections.  These non-GAAP  disclosures are not intended
to replace GAAP information but, rather, to supplement it.

     Farmer Mac developed  non-GAAP core earnings to present net income less the
after-tax effects of SFAS 133. Core earnings for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2004 were $5.4 million and $17.5 million,  respectively,  compared
to $5.5 million and $17.2 million for the three and nine months ended  September
30, 2003. The reconciliation of GAAP net income available to common stockholders
to core earnings is presented in the following table:

Business Volume.  New business volume for third quarter 2004 was $157.1 million,
down $192.0  million from the same period in 2003.  Presently,  Farmer Mac's new
business with agricultural mortgage lenders has been slowed by:

          o    reduced growth rates in the agricultural mortgage market;
          o    increased liquidity of agricultural borrowers;
          o    increased  capital and liquidity at those  agricultural  mortgage
               lenders in the current interest rate and regulatory environments;
               and
          o    increased    regulatory    pressure    on    government-sponsored
               enterprises.

Both FCA,  the federal  regulator  of Farmer Mac and the primary  lenders in the
Farm Credit System  ("FCS"),  and the Farm Credit System  Insurance  Corporation
("FCSIC"),  a U.S. Government  controlled  corporation managed by a three-member
board of  directors  composed  of the members of the FCA Board,  have  cautioned
other FCS institutions  against doing business with GSEs,  including Farmer Mac,
and FCSIC has raised  objections  to other FCS  institutions'  use of Farmer Mac
swaps; those communications diminished Farmer Mac's business volume and may have
an ongoing  effect.  See  "Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis of  Financial
Condition  and Results of  Operations--Regulatory  Matters" for other actions by
FCA that may potentially affect existing and future business volume.

     Looking ahead,  Farmer Mac is implementing a new strategic  alliance with a
Farm Credit System  institution  and sees additional  longer-term  opportunities
that  could  lead to  renewed  growth  in  business  volume  as a result  of the
Corporation's marketing efforts.

</TABLE>

     The  decreases  in  defaulted   loans  purchased  and  in  defaulted  loans
transferred to loans reflect a reduction in newly  delinquent  loans  underlying
Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs.

     The  weighted-average  age of the Farmer Mac I newly originated and current
seasoned  loans  purchased  during third quarter 2004 and third quarter 2003 was
less than one month. Of the Farmer Mac I newly  originated and current  seasoned
loans purchased during third quarter 2004 and third quarter 2003, 45 percent and
54 percent,  respectively,  had principal  amortization  periods longer than the
maturity   date,   resulting   in  balloon   payments   at   maturity,   with  a
weighted-average  remaining  term to  maturity  of 15.2  years  and 15.0  years,
respectively.  The  weighted-average  age of delinquent  loans  purchased out of
securitized  pools and LTSPCs  during third  quarter 2004 and third quarter 2003
was 4.7 years and 4.2 years, respectively.

     Approximately  285 lenders were actively  participating  either directly or
indirectly  in one or both of the Farmer Mac I or Farmer Mac II  programs  as of
September 30, 2004, with loans to approximately 20,000 borrowers.

     As of  September  30,  2004,  there were 152  approved  loan sellers in the
Farmer Mac I program ranging from  single-office  to multi-branch  institutions,
spanning community banks, Farm Credit System  associations,  mortgage companies,
large  multi-state  Farm Credit  System  banks,  commercial  banks and insurance
companies. During 2003, there were 81 approved loan sellers active in the Farmer
Mac I  program.  In  addition  to  participating  directly  in the  Farmer Mac I
program,  some of the approved loan sellers  enable other lenders to participate
indirectly  in the Farmer Mac I program by  managing  correspondent  networks of
lenders  from which they  purchase  loans to sell to Farmer Mac. As of September
30, 2004, more than 75 lenders were  participating  in those networks,  bringing
the total Farmer Mac I program participants to more than 200 as of September 30,
2004.

      Any lender authorized by the USDA to obtain a USDA guarantee on a loan may
be a seller in the Farmer Mac II program. As of September 30, 2004, there were
122 active sellers in the Farmer Mac II program, compared to 150 as of December
31, 2003 and 193 as of September 30, 2003. Sellers in the Farmer Mac II program
consist mostly of community and regional banks.

     As of September 30, 2004, outstanding  commitments to purchase Farmer Mac I
loans totaled $5.1  million,  compared to $6.5 million as of September 30, 2003.
Of the total Farmer Mac I commitments  outstanding  as of September 30, 2004 and
2003, $5.1 million and $2.1 million,  respectively,  were mandatory commitments.
Loans  submitted  for  approval or approved  but not yet  committed  to purchase
totaled $28.2 million as of September 30, 2004,  compared to $45.9 million as of
September  30,  2003.  Not all of these  loans will be  purchased,  as some will
ultimately be denied for credit reasons or withdrawn by the seller.

     USDA is currently  forecasting  national  farm cash receipts to increase to
$215.0 billion in 2004 from the $212.4 billion  forecasted level in 2003. Prices
available to farmers have been rising as a result of strong domestic and foreign
demand.  Forecasted net cash income on farms for 2004 is $55.9  billion,  a $7.1
billion decrease from 2003 forecasted levels of $63.0 billion,  but still higher
than the $49.1 billion level of 2002.  The  forecasted  net cash income on farms
for 2004 includes  government  payments of $10.3  billion,  as compared to $17.4
billion in 2003 and $11.0 billion in 2002.

     Despite  the  decline  in farm  income in 2004,  the rise in farm  business
assets,  debt, and equity values is expected to continue  through the end of the
year.  USDA  forecasts  the value of U.S.  farm real  estate  assets to rise 3.5
percent to $1.13  trillion in 2004, up from $1.09  trillion in 2003.  Total farm
real estate debt is expected to approach  $116.5  billion by the end of 2004,  a
4.7 percent  increase over the 2003 level.  This more moderate rise in farm real
estate  debt  follows  growth of 7.7  percent  in 2003 and 7.7  percent in 2002.
Sector  equity is  expected  to rise more than 3  percent,  as the gain in asset
values exceeds the increase in debt by approximately $36 billion.

     These financial  measures  reflect farm investors' and lenders'  collective
decisions about the long-term  expected  profitability  of farm  investments and
agriculture  generally.  These expectations should be favorable for Farmer Mac's
long-term  business  plans,  as they  indicate  increased  U.S. farm real estate
values,  an expanding  mortgageable farm real estate base, and a stronger equity
position in U.S. agriculture, which should in the aggregate improve Farmer Mac's
ability to recover in foreclosures.

Balance Sheet Review

     During the nine months ended September 30, 2004,  there were $248.2 million
of net principal  paydowns in program assets  (Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities
and  loans)  and a $239.3  million  reduction  in the  portfolio  of  investment
securities and cash and cash equivalents. Consistent with the decrease in assets
during  the  period,  outstanding  debt was paid  down by  $511.7  million  from
December  31, 2003 to  September  30, 2004.  For further  information  regarding
off-balance  sheet  program   activities,   see  "--Off-Balance   Sheet  Program
Activities" below.

     During  the  nine  months  ended  September  30,  2004,  accumulated  other
comprehensive  income/(loss)  decreased $3.2 million, which is the net after-tax
effect of a $7.2 million  decrease in unrealized  gains on securities  available
for sale and a $4.0 million increase in the fair value of financial  derivatives
classified as cash flow hedges. Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) is
not a component of Farmer Mac's core capital or regulatory capital.

     As of September 30, 2004, Farmer Mac's core capital totaled $233.6 million,
compared to $215.5  million as of December 31, 2003.  As of September  30, 2004,
core capital  exceeded  Farmer Mac's statutory  minimum  capital  requirement of
$128.1 million by $105.5 million.

     Farmer Mac was in compliance  with its risk-based  capital  standards as of
September 30, 2004. As of September 30, 2004, the risk-based capital stress test
generated a  regulatory  capital  requirement  of $43.5  million.  Farmer  Mac's
regulatory  capital of $256.1  million as of September  30, 2004  exceeded  that
amount by approximately  $212.6 million.  The increase in the risk-based capital
requirement  from December 31, 2003 ($38.8 million) to September 30, 2004 ($43.5
million) was a result of changes in the interest rate environment. Farmer Mac is
required  to  hold  capital  at the  higher  of the  statutory  minimum  capital
requirement or the amount required by the risk-based capital stress test.


Off-Balance Sheet Program Activities

     Farmer Mac offers  approved  agricultural  and rural  residential  mortgage
lenders two  off-balance  sheet  alternatives  to increase  their  liquidity  or
lending  capacity  while  retaining the cash flow  benefits of their loans:  (1)
Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities,  which are available through either the Farmer
Mac I program or the Farmer Mac II program,  and (2) LTSPCs, which are available
only  through  the Farmer Mac I program.  Both of these  alternatives  result in
off-balance  sheet  transactions  for Farmer  Mac.  See Note 3 to the  condensed
consolidated financial statements for further information regarding Farmer Mac's
off-balance sheet program activities.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Management

     Interest  Rate Risk.  Farmer Mac is  subject to  interest  rate risk on all
assets held for investment  because of possible  timing  differences in the cash
flows of the assets and related  liabilities.  This risk is primarily related to
loans held and on-balance sheet Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities because of the
ability of borrowers to prepay their mortgages before the scheduled  maturities,
thereby  increasing the risk of asset and liability cash flow  mismatches.  Cash
flow mismatches in a changing  interest rate environment can reduce the earnings
of the  Corporation  if assets repay sooner than expected and the resulting cash
flows must be reinvested in lower-yielding investments when Farmer Mac's funding
costs  cannot be  correspondingly  reduced,  or if assets repay more slowly than
expected and the associated debt must be replaced by higher-cost debt.

     Yield maintenance  provisions and other prepayment  penalties  contained in
many agricultural  mortgage loans reduce, but do not eliminate,  this prepayment
risk,  particularly in the case of a defaulted loan where yield  maintenance may
not be  collected.  Those  provisions  require  borrowers to make an  additional
payment when they prepay their loans so that,  when  reinvested with the prepaid
principal, yield maintenance payments generate substantially the same cash flows
that would have been generated had the loan not prepaid. Those provisions create
a disincentive  to prepayment and  compensate the  Corporation  for its interest
rate  risks to a large  degree.  As of  September  30,  2004,  58 percent of the
outstanding  balance of all loans  held and loans  underlying  on-balance  sheet
Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities (including 95 percent of all loans with fixed
interest  rates)  were  covered  by  yield  maintenance   provisions  and  other
prepayment  penalties.  Of the Farmer Mac I new and current  loans  purchased in
third  quarter  2004,  5  percent  had  yield  maintenance  or  another  form of
prepayment  protection.  None of the USDA-guaranteed  portions underlying Farmer
Mac II Guaranteed Securities had yield maintenance provisions.

     As of September  30, 2004,  Farmer Mac had $499.8  million of cash and cash
equivalents and $949.4 million of investment  securities.  Cash  equivalents and
investment securities pose only limited interest rate risk to Farmer Mac, due to
their closely matched funding. Farmer Mac's cash equivalents mature within three
months and are match-funded with discount notes having similar maturities. As of
September  30, 2004,  Farmer  Mac's  investment  securities  consisted of $736.8
million (77.6 percent) of floating rate  securities  that have rates that adjust
within one year. These floating rate investments are funded using:

          o    a series of  discount  note  issuances  in which each  successive
               discount note is issued and matures on or about the corresponding
               interest rate reset date of the related investment;
          o    floating-rate  notes having similar rate reset  provisions as the
               related investment; or
          o    fixed-rate  notes swapped to floating  rates having similar reset
               provisions as the related investment.

     The most  comprehensive  stress test of the long-term interest rate risk in
Farmer Mac's current  portfolio is the sensitivity of its Market Value of Equity
("MVE") to yield curve shocks.  MVE  represents  the present value of all future
cash flows from on- and  off-balance  sheet  assets,  liabilities  and financial
derivatives,  discounted at current  interest  rates and spreads.  The following
schedule  summarizes the results of Farmer Mac's MVE sensitivity  analysis as of
September  30, 2004 and  December  31, 2003 to an  immediate  and  instantaneous
parallel shift in the yield curve.

</FN>
</TABLE>

     During third quarter 2004,  Farmer Mac maintained a relatively low level of
interest  rate  sensitivity  through  ongoing  asset  and  liability  management
activities.  As of September 30, 2004, a uniform or  "parallel"  increase of 100
basis points would have increased  NII, a shorter-term  measure of interest rate
risk, by 9.4 percent,  while a parallel  decrease of 100 basis points would have
decreased NII by 7.6 percent.  Farmer Mac also measures the  sensitivity of both
MVE and  NII to a  variety  of  non-parallel  interest  rate  shocks,  including
flattening and steepening yield curve scenarios.  As of September 30, 2004, both
MVE and NII showed similar or lesser  sensitivity to  non-parallel  shocks as to
the parallel shocks. As of September 30, 2004,  Farmer Mac's effective  duration
gap,  another  standard measure of interest rate risk that measures the expected
life of assets compared to that of liabilities,  was minus 0.2 months,  compared
to minus 0.1 months as of December 31, 2003. Duration matching helps to maintain
the correlation of cash flows and stable  portfolio  earnings even when interest
rates are not stable. The relative  insensitivity of Farmer Mac's MVE and NII to
both parallel and non-parallel  interest rate shocks,  and its duration gap, are
indicators of the  effectiveness of the  Corporation's  approach to managing its
interest rate risk exposures.


     As of September 30, 2004,  Farmer Mac had $1.52 billion  combined  notional
amount of interest  rate swaps with terms  ranging from 1 to 15 years.  Of those
interest rate swaps,  $637.7 million were  floating-to-fixed  rate interest rate
swaps,  $205.0  million were  fixed-to-floating  interest  rate swaps and $677.6
million were basis and other swaps.

     Farmer Mac uses financial  derivatives as an end-user for hedging purposes,
not for trading or speculative  purposes.  When financial  derivatives  meet the
specific  hedge  criteria  under SFAS 133, they are accounted for as either fair
value  hedges or cash flow  hedges.  Financial  derivatives  that do not satisfy
those hedge  criteria  are not  accounted  for as hedges and changes in the fair
value of those financial derivatives are reported as a gain or loss on financial
derivatives and trading assets in the consolidated statements of operations. All
of Farmer Mac's financial  derivative  transactions are conducted under standard
collateralized  agreements that limit Farmer Mac's potential  credit exposure to
any counterparty.  As of September 30, 2004, Farmer Mac had no  uncollateralized
net exposure to any counterparty.

      Credit Risk. Farmer Mac's primary exposure to credit risk is the risk of
loss resulting from the inability of borrowers to repay their mortgages in
conjunction with a deficiency in the value of the collateral relative to the
amount outstanding on the mortgage and the costs of liquidation.

     Farmer Mac's  allowance  for losses is presented in four  components on its
consolidated balance sheet:

          o    an "Allowance for loan losses" on loans held for investment;
          o    a valuation  allowance on real estate owned, which is included in
               the balance  sheet under "Real  estate  owned,  net of  valuation
               allowance";
          o    an allowance for losses on loans underlying  post-1996 Act Farmer
               Mac I Guaranteed  Securities  and LTSPCs entered into or modified
               after January 1, 2003,  which is included in the balance sheet as
               a portion of the amount  reported as  "Guarantee  and  commitment
               obligation"; and
          o    an allowance for losses on loans underlying  post-1996 Act Farmer
               Mac I  Guaranteed  Securities  and LTSPCs  entered  into prior to
               January 1, 2003,  which is included  in the  balance  sheet under
               "Reserve for losses."

      Farmer Mac's provision for losses is presented in two components on its
consolidated statement of operations:

          o    a  "Provision  for  loan  losses,"  which  represents   estimated
               probable losses on Farmer Mac's loans held for investment; and
          o    a "Provision for losses,"  which  represents  estimated  probable
               losses on loans underlying  post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed
               Securities and LTSPCs and real estate owned.

     Farmer Mac estimates probable losses using a systematic process that begins
with  management's  evaluation  of the  results  of its  proprietary  loan  pool
simulation  and  guarantee  fee  model  (the  "Model").  The  Model  draws  upon
historical  information from a data set of agricultural  mortgage loans recorded
over a longer period of time than Farmer Mac's own experience to date,  screened
to include  only those  loans with  credit  characteristics  similar to those on
which Farmer Mac has assumed credit risk. The results generated by the Model are
modified by the  application of management's  judgment,  as required to take key
factors into account, including:

          o    economic conditions;
          o    geographic and agricultural  commodity  concentrations  in Farmer
               Mac's portfolio;
          o    the credit profile of Farmer Mac's portfolio;
          o    delinquency trends of Farmer Mac's portfolio;
          o    Farmer Mac's experience in the management and sale of real estate
               owned; and
          o    historical  charge-off  and recovery  activities  of Farmer Mac's
               portfolio.

     Management  believes that the general  allowance,  which is the  difference
between the total allowance for losses (generated  through use of the Model) and
the specific  allowances,  adequately covers any probable losses inherent in the
portfolio of performing loans under Statement of Financial  Accounting Standards
No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies ("SFAS 5").

     The  following  table  summarizes  the changes in the  components of Farmer
Mac's  allowance  for losses for the three and nine months ended  September  30,
2004 and 2003:

</TABLE>

     Farmer Mac's total  provision for losses was $1.6 million for third quarter
2004,  compared to $2.2 million for third  quarter  2003.  During third  quarter
2004,  Farmer Mac charged off $1.1 million in losses  against the  allowance for
losses and had $0.1 million in recoveries  for net  charge-offs of $1.0 million.
During third quarter 2003, Farmer Mac charged off $1.4 million in losses against
the  allowance  for  losses  and  had  $0.1  million  in  recoveries  for  a net
charge-offs of $1.3 million. The net charge-offs for third quarter 2004 and 2003
did not include  previously accrued or advanced interest on loans and Farmer Mac
I Guaranteed  Securities.  During second quarter 2004,  Farmer Mac received $1.8
million  from two  sellers  (one of which was a related  party) for  breaches of
representations  and  warranties  associated  with prior  sales of  agricultural
mortgage loans to Farmer Mac, which amount Farmer Mac had previously charged off
as losses on the associated  loans.  This recovery was reported as miscellaneous
income and is not  reflected  in the net  charge-offs  for the nine months ended
September  30, 2004  presented  above.  As of September  30, 2004,  Farmer Mac's
allowance  for  losses  totaled  $22.5  million,  or  47  basis  points  of  the
outstanding  principal balance of loans held and loans underlying  post-1996 Act
Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities  and LTSPCs,  compared to $22.1  million (44
basis points) as of December 31, 2003.

     As of September 30, 2004, Farmer Mac's 90-day  delinquencies  totaled $47.6
million and represented 1.01 percent of the principal  balance of all loans held
and loans  underlying  post-1996  Act Farmer  Mac I  Guaranteed  Securities  and
LTSPCs, compared to $47.1 million (0.98 percent) as of September 30, 2003. As of
September 30, 2004,  Farmer Mac's  non-performing  assets (which includes 90-day
delinquencies,  loans  performing  under either their  original  loan terms or a
court-approved bankruptcy plan, and real estate owned) totaled $75.0 million and
represented  1.58 percent of the  principal  balance of all loans held and loans
underlying post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs, compared
to $84.6 million (1.74  percent) as of September 30, 2003.  Loans that have been
restructured  after  delinquency were  insignificant and are included within the
reported 90-day delinquency and non-performing  asset disclosures.  From quarter
to quarter,  Farmer Mac anticipates that 90-day delinquencies and non-performing
assets will  fluctuate,  both in dollars and as a percentage of the  outstanding
portfolio,  with higher levels likely at the end of the first and third quarters
of each year corresponding to the semi-annual (January 1st and July 1st) payment
characteristics of most Farmer Mac I loans.

non-performing assets and 90-day delinquencies:

</TABLE>


     As of September  30, 2004,  approximately  $1.8 billion  (31.0  percent) of
Farmer Mac's  outstanding  loans held and loans underlying  post-1996 Act Farmer
Mac I  Guaranteed  Securities  and  LTSPCs  were in their peak  delinquency  and
default  years  (approximately  years  three  through  five after  origination),
compared to $1.5 billion (36.1  percent) of such loans as of September 30, 2003.
The  Model  takes  the   portfolio  age   distribution   and   maturation   into
consideration.  Accordingly,  those trends did not cause management to alter the
Model's projection for the provisions for losses.

     As  of  September  30,  2004,  Farmer  Mac  analyzed  the  following  three
categories of assets for  impairment,  based on the fair value of the underlying
collateral:

          o    $75.0 million of non-performing assets;
          o    $27.2  million  of loans for which  Farmer Mac has  adjusted  the
               timing of  borrowers'  payment  schedules,  but still  expects to
               collect all amounts  due and has not made  economic  concessions;
               and
          o    $35.9  million  of  performing  loans that have  previously  been
               delinquent   or  are  secured  by  real   estate  that   produces
               commodities currently under stress.

Those  individual  assessments  covered  a total of  $138.1  million  of  assets
measured  for  impairment  against  updated  appraised  values,   other  updated
collateral  valuations or  discounted  values.  Of the $138.1  million of assets
analyzed, $126.6 million were adequately  collateralized.  For the $11.5 million
that  were  not  adequately  collateralized,  individual  collateral  shortfalls
totaled $1.3 million.  Accordingly,  Farmer Mac allocated specific allowances of
$1.3 million to those  under-collateralized  assets as of September 30, 2004. As
of  September  30,  2004,  after  the  allocation  of  specific   allowances  to
under-collateralized  loans,  Farmer Mac had additional  non-specific or general
allowances of $21.2  million,  bringing the total  allowance for losses to $22.5
million.

     The following table summarizes  Farmer Mac's assets  specifically  reviewed
for impairment and allowance for losses:

Liquidity and Capital Resources

     Farmer Mac has  sufficient  liquidity and capital  resources to support its
operations  for the next twelve  months and has a  contingency  funding  plan to
handle unanticipated disruptions in its access to the capital markets.

     Debt Issuance. Farmer Mac funds its program operations primarily by issuing
debt  obligations of various  maturities in the public capital  markets.  Farmer
Mac's  debt  obligations  consist  of  discount  notes  and  medium-term  notes,
including  floating rate notes,  issued to obtain funds principally to cover the
costs of  purchasing  and holding  loans and  securities  (including  Farmer Mac
Guaranteed  Securities).  Farmer Mac also issues  discount notes and medium-term
notes to obtain funds for investments, transaction costs and guarantee payments.
The interest and principal on Farmer Mac's debt are not guaranteed by and do not
constitute  debts or  obligations  of FCA or the United  States or any agency or
instrumentality  of the United  States  other than Farmer Mac.  Farmer Mac is an
institution  of the  Farm  Credit  System,  but is not  liable  for any  debt or
obligation of any other institution of the Farm Credit System. Likewise, neither
the Farm Credit System nor any other  individual  institution of the Farm Credit
System is liable  for any debt or  obligation  of Farmer  Mac.  Income on Farmer
Mac's discount notes and  medium-term  notes has no tax exemption  under federal
law from federal,  state or local taxation. The Corporation's discount notes and
medium-term notes are not currently rated by a nationally recognized statistical
rating  organization  (NRSRO),  although  Farmer Mac intends to obtain a rating.
(See "--Regulatory Matters" below.)

     Farmer Mac's Board of Directors has  authorized  the issuance of up to $5.0
billion of  discount  notes and  medium-term  notes (of which $3.4  billion  was
outstanding  as of  September  30,  2004),  subject  to  periodic  review of the
adequacy of that level relative to Farmer Mac's borrowing  requirements.  Farmer
Mac  invests the  proceeds of such  issuances  in loans,  Farmer Mac  Guaranteed
Securities  and  non-program  investment  assets in accordance  with  guidelines
established by its board of directors.

     Liquidity.  The  funding  and  liquidity  needs of  Farmer  Mac's  business
programs are driven by the purchase and  retention of eligible  loans and Farmer
Mac  Guaranteed  Securities,  the  maturities of Farmer Mac's discount notes and
medium-term notes and payment of principal and interest on Farmer Mac Guaranteed
Securities. Farmer Mac's primary sources of funds to meet these needs are:

          o    principal  and  interest   payments  and  ongoing  guarantee  and
               commitment   fees  received  on  loans,   Farmer  Mac  Guaranteed
               Securities and LTSPCs;
          o    principal  and  interest   payments   received  from   investment
               securities; and
          o    the issuance of discount notes and medium-term notes.

     As a result  of  Farmer  Mac's  regular  issuance  of  discount  notes  and
medium-term   notes,   as  well  as  its   status  as  a   federally   chartered
instrumentality  of the  United  States,  Farmer Mac has been able to issue debt
securities in the capital markets at favorable rates of interest. Farmer Mac has
also used  fixed-to-floating  interest  rate swaps,  combined  with  medium-term
notes, as a source of floating rate funding, and floating-to-fixed interest rate
swaps, combined with discount note issuances, as a source of fixed-rate funding.
While the swap market may  provide  favorable  fixed  rates,  swap  transactions
expose  Farmer Mac to the risk of future  widening of its own  issuance  spreads
versus  corresponding  LIBOR  rates.  If the spreads on the Farmer Mac  discount
notes  were to  increase  relative  to LIBOR,  Farmer  Mac would be exposed to a
commensurate  reduction on its net interest yield on the notional  amount of its
floating-to-fixed  interest  rate  swaps and  other  LIBOR-based  floating  rate
assets.  Farmer Mac  compensates for this risk by maintaining the flexibility to
adjust the required net yield on program  asset  purchases to reflect the change
in the  discount  note to LIBOR  relationship,  as  necessary.  Farmer  Mac also
maintains a practice of issuing  floating  rate notes to fund its floating  rate
assets.

     For  liquidity,  Farmer Mac maintains an  investment  portfolio of cash and
cash equivalents  (including  commercial paper and other short-term money market
instruments)  and  investment  securities  consisting  mostly of  floating  rate
securities  whose rates reset within one year,  and a Farmer Mac II portfolio of
USDA Guaranteed Portions (full faith and credit of the U.S.  Government).  As of
September  30,  2004,  Farmer  Mac's  cash  and  cash  equivalents,   investment
securities and USDA Guaranteed  Portions,  were $499.8 million,  $949.4 million,
and $685.7 million,  respectively, a combined 60.0 percent of total liabilities.
Farmer Mac has a policy of  maintaining  a minimum of 60 days of liquidity and a
target of 90 days of liquidity. For third quarter 2004, Farmer Mac maintained an
average of greater than 90 days of liquidity.


     Capital. During third quarter 2004, Farmer Mac repurchased 70,951 shares of
its Class C Non-Voting  Common  Stock,  at an average price of $19.88 per share,
pursuant to the  Corporation's  previously  announced stock repurchase  program.
These  repurchases  reduced  the  Corporation's  capital by  approximately  $1.4
million.

Regulatory Matters

     Regulatory  actions continue to affect Farmer Mac's business outlook.  Both
FCA and FCSIC have  cautioned FCS  institutions  about doing business with GSEs,
including  Farmer  Mac,  and  FCSIC  has  raised  technical  objections  to  FCS
institutions' use of Farmer Mac AMBS swaps.

     During second quarter 2004, FCA published a proposed regulation relating to
Farmer Mac's investments and liquidity.  Farmer Mac expects to be able to comply
with the  regulation  if it is  adopted in its  current  form,  though  analysis
indicates it could limit future increases in Farmer Mac's non-program investment
portfolio and the related net interest  income.  The Corporation  disagrees with
certain  aspects  of the  proposed  regulation  and  submitted  comments  on the
proposal to FCA accordingly.

     On August 6, 2004, FCA published a proposed  regulation that, if adopted as
proposed,  could  adversely  affect Farmer Mac's business by  establishing a new
risk-weight allocation of capital applicable to Farmer Mac transactions with FCS
institutions,  a major  segment of Farmer  Mac's  customer  base.  The  proposed
regulation would require FCS  institutions to risk-weight  assets on their books
that are guaranteed by a GSE based on the financial  strength rating of the GSE,
as determined  by an NRSRO.  Under the proposed  regulation:  (a) the 20 percent
risk-weight would apply to such assets only if the GSE guarantor had a AAA or AA
rating from an NRSRO; (b) an A rating would result in a 50 percent  risk-weight;
and (c) a lower rating (or no rating) would result in a 100 percent risk-weight.
Farmer Mac is  currently  unrated.  Currently,  all banking  regulators  and FCA
accord a 20 percent  risk-weight  to assets  backed by  guarantees of government
sponsored  enterprises (GSEs) such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Farmer Mac. The
proposed  regulation  is subject  to a 90-day  public  comment  period  and,  as
drafted, would have an effective date eighteen months after the final regulation
is published.

     If the proposed  regulation  is adopted as a final rule in its current form
and  Farmer  Mac does not  receive  a rating of at least AA  within  the  period
provided  for in the proposed  regulation,  not only would the benefit to an FCS
institution of doing  business with Farmer Mac be diminished  after the adoption
of the regulation, but also, based on the language of the proposed regulation, a
significant  portion of the current  $2.8  billion of  outstanding  Farmer Mac I
guarantees and  commitments  currently in place with FCS  institutions  might be
subject to early termination. There can be no assurance that the regulation will
not be adopted as a final rule in its current  form,  or in a modified form with
substantially the same effect. Likewise,  Farmer Mac currently is not rated, and
there can be no assurance  that Farmer Mac would receive a AAA or AA rating from
an NRSRO.  As set forth in prior  disclosures,  Farmer  Mac  disagrees  with the
proposed  regulation  as it would affect the  Corporation,  and has  submitted a
comment letter to FCA setting forth its position.

     While Farmer Mac intends to obtain a rating from an NRSRO,  the Corporation
believes  it is  prudent  to wait to  pursue a rating  until FCA  concludes  its
consideration  of the  above-mentioned  two  proposed  FCA  regulations,  as the
outcome may be influenced by the regulatory process.

Other Matters

      On October 7, 2004, for the first time Farmer Mac's Board of Directors
declared a quarterly dividend on the Corporation's three classes of common stock
- Class A Voting Common Stock, Class B Voting Common Stock, and Class C Non -
Voting Common Stock. The quarterly dividend of $0.10 per common share will be
payable on December 31, 2004 to common stockholders of record as of December 15,
2004.

      (1) Farmer Mac assumes 100 percent of the credit risk on post-1996 Act
         loans. Pre-1996 Act loans back securities that are supported by
         unguaranteed first loss subordinated interests representing
         approximately 10 percent of the balance of the loans. Farmer Mac II
         loans are guaranteed by the USDA.

      (2) The Loans and Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs amounts reflect the
         conversion of $722.3 million of existing LTSPCs to a Farmer Mac I

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

     Farmer Mac is exposed to market  risk  attributable  to changes in interest
rates.  Farmer Mac manages this market risk by entering  into various  financial
transactions, including financial derivatives, and by monitoring its exposure to
changes  in  interest  rates.  See  "Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of
Financial  Condition  and Results of  Operations--Quantitative  and  Qualitative
Disclosures  About  Market  Risk   Management--Interest   Rate  Risk"  for  more
information  about Farmer Mac's exposure to interest rate risk and strategies to
manage such risk. For information  regarding  Farmer Mac's use of and accounting
policies for financial derivatives,  see Note 1(c) to the condensed consolidated
financial  statements.  See  "Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition  and  Results of  Operations--Liquidity  and  Capital  Resources"  for
further information regarding Farmer Mac's debt issuance and liquidity risks.


Item 4. Controls and Procedures

     Farmer Mac maintains  disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed in the Corporation's  periodic filings
under the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"),  including this
report, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis. These
disclosure  controls and procedures include controls and procedures  designed to
ensure that  information  required to be  disclosed  under the  Exchange  Act is
accumulated and communicated to the  Corporation's  management on a timely basis
to allow decisions regarding required  disclosure.  Farmer Mac's Chief Executive
Officer and Chief  Financial  Officer have  evaluated the  effectiveness  of the
design and operation of the Corporation's disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined under Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of September
30, 2004. Based upon that evaluation,  Farmer Mac's Chief Executive  Officer and
Chief  Financial  Officer  have  concluded  that  the  Corporation's  disclosure
controls  and  procedures  are  adequate and  effective.  For the quarter  ended
September 30, 2004,  there were no significant  changes in Farmer Mac's internal
controls,  or in other factors that have  materially  affected or are reasonably
likely materially to affect the  Corporation's  internal controls over financial
reporting.

          Pursuant to Farmer Mac's  policy that permits  Directors of Farmer Mac
          to elect to receive shares of Class C Non-Voting  Common Stock in lieu
          of their annual cash retainers,  on July 2, 2004, Farmer Mac issued an

          issue price of $23.93 per share,  to the ten  Directors who elected to
          receive such stock in lieu of their cash retainers.

          During third quarter 2004,  Farmer Mac granted  options under its 1997
          Stock Option Plan to purchase an aggregate of 251,984  shares of Class
          C Non-Voting  Common Stock to officers and  employees.  218,984 of the
          options granted have an exercise price of $19.86 per share,  28,000 of
          the options  granted have an exercise  price of $20.32 per share,  and
          5,000 of the  options  granted  have an  exercise  price of $20.01 per
