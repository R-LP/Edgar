Item 1. Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

     The following interim condensed  consolidated  financial  statements of the
Federal  Agricultural  Mortgage  Corporation ("Farmer Mac" or the "Corporation")
have been prepared,  without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the
Securities  and Exchange  Commission.  These  condensed  consolidated  financial
statements reflect all normal and recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion
of management,  necessary to present a fair statement of the financial condition
and the  results of  operations  and cash  flows of Farmer  Mac for the  interim
periods  presented.   Certain  information  and  footnote  disclosures  normally
included in annual  consolidated  financial  statements  have been  condensed or

disclosures are adequate to present fairly the condensed  consolidated financial
position,   condensed   consolidated   results  of   operations   and  condensed
consolidated  cash flows as of the dates and for the  periods  presented.  These
condensed  consolidated  financial statements should be read in conjunction with
the audited 2002 consolidated financial statements of Farmer Mac included in the
Corporation's  Form 10-K for the year  ended  December  31,  2002.  Results  for

Note 1.  Accounting Policies

     (a)  Cash and Cash Equivalents

     Farmer Mac considers  highly liquid  investment  securities  with remaining
maturities  of  three  months  or  less  at the  time  of  purchase  to be  cash
equivalents. Changes in the balance of cash and cash equivalents are reported in
the Condensed  Consolidated  Statements of Cash Flows.  The following table sets
forth information regarding certain cash and non-cash transactions for the three
months ended March 31, 2003 and 2002.

     (b)  Loans

     As of March 31, 2003,  loans held by Farmer Mac included $34.6 million held
for sale and $976.3 million held for investment.  As of December 31, 2002, loans
held by Farmer Mac included  $37.0 million held for sale and $929.1 million held
for investment.  Detailed information regarding the allowance for loan losses is
presented in Note 1(c).

     (c)  Allowance for Losses

     As of March 31, 2003,  Farmer Mac maintained a $21.1 million  allowance for
losses to cover estimated  probable losses on loans held, real estate owned, and
loans  underlying   Long-Term  Standby  Purchase   Commitments   ("LTSPCs")  and
securities  guaranteed  by Farmer Mac under the  Farmer Mac I program  after the
1996  revision  to  its  charter   ("Post-1996   Act  Farmer  Mac  I  Guaranteed
Securities").  (See  Note 2 for a  description  of  LTSPCs.)  The  allowance  is
increased  through periodic  provisions for loan losses that are charged against
net  interest  income and  provisions  for losses that are charged to  operating
expense and reduced by charge-offs for actual losses, net of recoveries.

     Farmer Mac's allowance for losses is estimated  using a systematic  process
that begins with management's  evaluation of the results of its proprietary loan
pool  simulation  and  guarantee fee model (the  "Model");  those results may be
modified by the  application  of  management's  judgment that takes into account
factors  including:
     o    economic conditions;
     o    geographic and agricultural  commodity  concentrations of Farmer Mac's
          portfolio;
     o    the credit profile of Farmer Mac's portfolio;
     o    delinquency  trends  of  Farmer  Mac's  portfolio;  and
     o    historical   charge-offs  and  recovery  activities  of  Farmer  Mac's
          portfolio.

     The Model offers historical loss experience on agricultural  mortgage loans
similar to those on which Farmer Mac has assumed  credit risk, but over a longer
period of time than Farmer Mac's own experience to date. Farmer Mac's systematic
methodology for determining its allowance for losses is expected to migrate over
time,  away from the Model and  toward  the  increased  use of Farmer  Mac's own
historical  portfolio loss experience,  as that experience continues to develop.
During this  migration,  Farmer Mac will  continue  to use the results  from the
Model,  augmented by the  application of management's  judgment,  to develop its
loan loss allowance.

     Management  believes that its use of this  methodology  produces a reliable
estimate of total probable  losses,  as of the balance sheet date, for all loans
included in Farmer Mac's  portfolio,  including loans held and loans  underlying
Post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs.

     The table below summarizes the three components of the allowance for losses
as of March 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002.

</TABLE>

     Farmer Mac's total  provision for losses was $2.1 million for first quarter
2003,  compared to $2.0 million for first  quarter  2002.  During first  quarter
2003,  Farmer Mac charged off $1.2 million in losses  against the  allowance for
losses and recovered $0.2 million from  previously  charged off losses,  for net
charge-offs of $1.0 million.  During first quarter 2002,  Farmer Mac charged off
$0.9  million  in losses  against  the  allowance  for losses  and  recorded  no
recoveries  from  previously  charged off losses,  for net  charge-offs  of $0.9
million.  The net  charge-offs  for first  quarter 2003 and 2002  included  $0.2
million  and $0.1  million,  respectively,  related  to  previously  accrued  or
advanced interest on Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities.

     No  allowance  for losses has been made for loans  underlying  Farmer Mac I
Guaranteed  Securities issued prior to the Farm Credit System Reform Act of 1996
(the "1996 Act") or securities  issued under the Farmer Mac II program  ("Farmer
Mac II Guaranteed Securities").  Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities issued prior
to the 1996 Act are supported by unguaranteed first loss subordinated interests,
which are expected to exceed the  estimated  credit  losses on those loans.  The
guaranteed portions of loans collateralizing Farmer Mac II Guaranteed Securities
are  guaranteed by the United States  Department of Agriculture  ("USDA").  Each
USDA  guarantee  is an  obligation  backed by the full  faith and  credit of the
United States. To date, Farmer Mac has experienced no losses on any pre-1996 Act
Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities or on any Farmer Mac II Guaranteed Securities
and does not expect to incur any such losses in the future.

     (d)  Financial Derivatives

     Farmer Mac enters into  financial  derivative  transactions  principally to
protect  against  the risk from the  effects of market  price or  interest  rate
movements on the value of certain assets and future cash flows,  not for trading
or  speculative  purposes.  Farmer Mac enters into interest rate swap  contracts
principally to adjust the  characteristics  of its short-term debt to match more
closely the cash flow and duration  characteristics of its longer-term  mortgage
and other assets,  and also to adjust the  characteristics of its long-term debt
to  match  more  closely  the  cash  flow and  duration  characteristics  of its
short-term assets,  thereby reducing interest rate risk. These transactions also
provide an overall lower  effective  cost of borrowing  than would  otherwise be
available in the conventional debt market.

     All financial  derivatives  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value
as  a  freestanding  asset  or  liability.   Financial  derivatives  in  hedging
relationships  that mitigate exposure to changes in the fair value of assets are
considered  fair value hedges.  Financial  derivatives in hedging  relationships
that mitigate the exposure to the  variability in expected  future cash flows or
other  forecasted  transactions  are  considered  cash  flow  hedges.  Financial
derivatives  that do not satisfy the hedging  criteria of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative  Instruments and Hedging
Activities  as amended  ("SFAS 133") are not accounted for as hedges and changes
in the fair  values of those  financial  derivatives  are  reported in income or
expense.

     The net after-tax  increase to earnings under SFAS 133 during first quarter
2003 totaled $2.5 million, and the net after-tax increase to other comprehensive
income (loss) totaled $1.1 million.  Substantially  all of the increase to other
comprehensive  income (loss)  represented  changes in the fair values of forward
sale contracts,  interest rate swap contracts and settled forward sale contracts
using fair values as of March 31,  2003.  As of March 31,  2003,  Farmer Mac had
approximately  $61.6  million of net  after-tax  unrealized  losses on cash flow
hedges included in accumulated other comprehensive  income (loss). These amounts
will be  reclassified  into earnings in the same period or periods  during which
the hedged  forecasted  transactions  (either  the  payment of  interest  or the
issuance of discount  notes)  affect  earnings  or  immediately  when it becomes
probable that the original hedged  forecasted  transaction will not occur within
two months of the  originally  specified  date.  During the next twelve  months,
Farmer Mac  estimates  that $6.9  million of the amount  currently  reported  in
accumulated  other  comprehensive   income  (loss)  will  be  reclassified  into
earnings.  For the quarter ended March 31, 2003, the ineffectiveness  related to
Farmer Mac's designated hedges was insignificant.

     SFAS 133 also required, as the change in the fair value of a hedged item, a
$1.5 million increase in the line item "loans" on the consolidated balance sheet
for first quarter 2003. For first quarter 2002, the recorded  change in the fair
value of a hedged item was a $0.6 million decrease in "loans."

     (e)  Earnings Per Common Share

     Basic earnings per common share are based on the weighted-average number of
common shares  outstanding.  Diluted  earnings per common share are based on the
weighted-average  number of common  shares  outstanding  adjusted to include all
potentially  dilutive common stock options.  The following  schedule  reconciles
basic and diluted earnings per common share for the three months ended March 31,
2003 and 2002:

     (f)  Preferred Stock

     On May 6, 2002, the Corporation  issued 700,000 shares of 6.40%  Cumulative
Preferred Stock,  Series A ("Series A Preferred Stock"),  which has a redemption
price and  liquidation  preference of $50.00 per share,  plus accrued and unpaid
dividends,  if any. The Series A Preferred  Stock does not have a maturity date.
Beginning  on June 30,  2012,  Farmer  Mac has the option to redeem the Series A
Preferred  Stock at any time,  in whole or in part, at the  redemption  price of
$50.00 per share,  plus accrued and unpaid  dividends  through and including the
redemption date, if any. Farmer Mac will pay cumulative  dividends on the Series
A Preferred  Stock  quarterly  in arrears,  when and if declared by the Board of
Directors.  The costs of issuing  the Series A Preferred  Stock were  charged to
additional paid-in capital.

     On February 6, 2003, Farmer Mac's Board of Directors declared a dividend of
$0.80 per share on the Series A Preferred  Stock for the period from  January 1,
2003 to March 31, 2003, which was paid on March 31, 2003.

     (g)  Stock-Based Compensation

     Farmer Mac accounts for its stock-based  employee  compensation plans using
the intrinsic value method of accounting for employee stock options  pursuant to
Accounting  Principles  Board  Opinion No. 25,  Accounting  for Stock  Issued to
Employees,  and has adopted  the  disclosure-only  provisions  of  Statement  of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based  Compensation
("SFAS 123"), as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148,
Accounting for Stock-Based  Compensation-Transition and Disclosure ("SFAS 148").
Accordingly,  no  compensation  expense was  recognized in first quarter 2003 or
first quarter 2002 for employee  stock option  plans.  Had Farmer Mac elected to
use the fair value method of accounting for employee stock options,  there would
have been no effect on net income available to common  stockholders and earnings
per share for the  three  months  ended  March  31,  2003 and 2002,  as no stock
options were granted during either period.

     The following table  summarizes  stock option activity for the three months
ended March 31, 2003 and 2002:

     (h)  Reclassifications

     Certain  reclassifications of prior period information were made to conform
to the current period presentation.

     (i)  New Accounting Standards

     On January 1, 2003,  Farmer Mac adopted  Statement of Financial  Accounting
Standards No. 145,  Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of
FASB  Statement No. 13 and  Technical  Corrections  ("SFAS 145") which  requires
gains and losses from the  extinguishment or repurchase of debt to be classified
as extraordinary items only if they meet the criteria for such classification in
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30, Reporting the Results of Operations,
Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business and  Extraordinary,
Unusual and Infrequently  Occurring Events and Transactions ("APB 30"). Prior to
the  adoption  of this  standard,  gains and losses from the  extinguishment  or
repurchase  of debt  were  classified  as  extraordinary  items.  This  standard
eliminates that  classification for most debt  extinguishments  and requires the
reclassification of certain gains and losses that were previously categorized as
extraordinary.  Such a reclassification  was reflected in Farmer Mac's condensed
consolidated financial statements as of and for the three months ended March 31,
2002.

     On January 1, 2003, Farmer Mac adopted the liability recognition provisions
of the Financial  Accounting  Standards Board Interpretation No. 45, Guarantor's
Accounting  and  Disclosure  Requirements  for  Guarantees,  Including  Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others ("FIN 45"). These provisions require Farmer
Mac to  recognize,  at the  inception of a guarantee,  a liability  for the fair
value of its  obligation  to stand  ready to  perform  under  the  terms of each
guarantee  agreement  and an asset  that is equal to the fair  value of the fees
that will be received over the life of each  guarantee.  Subsequently,  both the
asset and the  liability  are measured  and recorded at their fair value.  These
provisions  have  been  applied  on  a  prospective   basis  to  guarantees  and
commitments that were issued or modified on or after January 1, 2003. See Note 2
for additional  information on Farmer Mac's guarantee obligations and LTSPCs and
the  manner in which the  obligations  to "stand  ready" has been  reflected  in
Farmer Mac's condensed consolidated financial statements.

Note 2.  Off-Balance Sheet Guarantees and Long-Term Standby Purchase Commitments

     Farmer Mac offers  approved  agricultural  and rural  residential  mortgage
lenders two  off-balance  sheet  alternatives  to increase  their  liquidity  or
lending  capacity  while  retaining the cash flow  benefits of their loans:  (1)
Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities,  which are available through either the Farmer
Mac I program or the Farmer Mac II program,  and (2) LTSPCs, which are available
only through the Farmer Mac I program. To be eligible for Farmer Mac I secondary
market  transactions,  a  loan  must  meet  Farmer  Mac's  credit  underwriting,
appraisal  and  documentation  standards.  Accordingly,  Farmer Mac believes the
credit risk it assumes in each of the two Farmer Mac I transaction  alternatives
is the same.

     For all guarantees and commitments that were executed on or before December
31, 2002,  Farmer Mac's policy for the  recognition  of guarantee fees on Farmer
Mac Guaranteed  Securities and commitment fees on LTSPCs is to recognize them on
an accrual basis over the life of the underlying  loans.  Because these fees are
paid monthly in arrears,  no guarantee  fees or commitment  fees are unearned at
the end of any  reporting  period.  If Farmer Mac  purchases a  delinquent  loan
underlying  a Farmer  Mac  Guaranteed  Security  or an LTSPC,  Farmer  Mac stops
accruing the guarantee or  commitment  fee upon the purchase of the loan. If the
loan  becomes  current and is  repurchased  by the seller under the terms of the
LTSPC, Farmer Mac resumes accrual of the fee.

     For all guarantees and  commitments  issued or modified on or after January
1, 2003, Farmer Mac recognizes, at the inception of the guarantee or commitment,
an asset that is equal to the fair value of the fees that will be received  over
the life of each  guarantee or commitment  and a liability for the fair value of
its obligation to stand ready to perform under the guarantee or commitment. Both
the asset and the liability are subsequently measured and recorded at their fair
value in Farmer Mac's condensed consolidated financial statements.

Off-Balance Sheet Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities

     Periodically Farmer Mac transfers  agricultural  mortgage loans into trusts
that are used as vehicles for the  securitization of the transferred  assets and
the  beneficial  interests  in the trusts are sold to third party  investors  as
Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities.  Farmer Mac guarantees the timely payment of
principal and interest on the certificates  issued by the trusts,  regardless of
whether the trusts actually receive scheduled payments on the related underlying
loans. As consideration  for Farmer Mac's assumption of the credit risk on these
mortgage pass-through certificates,  Farmer Mac receives an annual guarantee fee
that is  based  upon  the  outstanding  balance  of the  Farmer  Mac  Guaranteed
Security.

     Farmer Mac is  required  to  perform  under its  obligation  when the loans
underlying  Farmer  Mac  Guaranteed  Securities  do  not  make  their  scheduled
installment payments.  When a loan underlying a Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Security
becomes 90 days or more past due,  Farmer Mac has the option to  repurchase  the
loan from the trust and generally does  repurchase  such loans thereby  reducing
the principal balance of the outstanding Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities.

     The  following  table  presents the maximum  principal  amount of potential
undiscounted  future  payments  that  Farmer Mac could be required to make under
off-balance  sheet  Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities  as of March 31, 2003 and
December 31, 2002, not including  offsets  provided by any recourse  provisions,
recoveries from third parties or collateral for the underlying loans.

</TABLE>


     If Farmer Mac  exercises  its option to purchase a loan that is  collateral
for a Farmer  Mac I  Guaranteed  Security,  Farmer  Mac would  have the right to
enforce  the terms of the loan,  and in the event of a  default,  would have the
right to foreclose upon the underlying collateral. Farmer Mac typically recovers
a significant  portion of the value of defaulted loans purchased  either through
borrower  payments,  loan payoffs,  payments by third parties or foreclosure and
sale of the collateral.

     Farmer Mac has recourse to the USDA for any amounts advanced for the timely
payment of principal and interest on Farmer Mac II Guaranteed  Securities.  That
recourse is the USDA guarantee, a full faith and credit obligation of the United
States  that  becomes   enforceable   if  a  lender  fails  to  repurchase   the
USDA-guaranteed  portion from its owner within 30 days after written demand from
the owner when (a) the borrower under the guaranteed loan is in default not less
than  60  days  in  the  payment  of  any  principal  or  interest  due  on  the
USDA-guaranteed  portion, or (b) the lender has failed to remit to the owner the
payment made by the borrower on the USDA-guaranteed  portion or any related loan
subsidy within 30 days after the lender's receipt of the payment.

     As of March 31, 2003, the weighted-average  remaining maturity of all loans
underlying  off-balance  sheet Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities was 13.4 years.
For the off-balance sheet Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities that were executed
on or before  December  31,  2002,  Farmer Mac has  recorded  an  allowance  for
probable  losses that was $1.2  million as of March 31, 2003 and $1.3 million as
of December 31, 2002.  For those  securities  that were issued or modified on or
after January 1, 2003,  Farmer Mac has recorded the fair value of its obligation
to stand ready under the  guarantee as a liability.  As of March 31, 2003,  this
liability approximated $0.2 million and was included in other liabilities on the
condensed consolidated balance sheet.

Long-Term Standby Purchase Commitments

     An LTSPC is a commitment by Farmer Mac to purchase eligible loans on one or
more undetermined  future dates. In consideration for Farmer Mac's assumption of
the credit  risk on loans  underlying  an LTSPC,  Farmer Mac  receives an annual
commitment fee on the outstanding balance of those loans in monthly installments
based on the outstanding balance of those loans.

     An LTSPC permits a seller to nominate from its portfolio a segregated  pool
of loans, which are retained in the seller's portfolio. Upon nomination,  Farmer
Mac reviews the loan  portfolio to confirm that it is in compliance  with Farmer
Mac's  underwriting  standards.  Upon Farmer Mac's  acceptance of the conforming
loans, the seller effectively transfers the credit risk on those loans to Farmer
Mac,  thereby  reducing the seller's  credit and  concentration  exposures  and,
consequently, its regulatory capital requirements and loss reserve requirements.
Credit risk is transferred  via Farmer Mac's  commitment to purchase some or all
of the segregated loans from the  counterparty  based upon Farmer Mac's original
credit review and acceptance of the credit risk on the loans.

     The  specific  events or  circumstances  that would  require  Farmer Mac to
perform  under its LTSPCs  include  (1) the  determination  by the holder of the
LTSPC to sell some or all of the loans  under the LTSPC to Farmer Mac or (2) the
failure of the borrower under any loan to make  installment  payments under that
loan for a period of 120 days.

     The LTSPC commits Farmer Mac to purchase these loans:

     o    At par, if  the loans become four months delinquent,  with accrued and
          unpaid interest payable out of any future loan payments or liquidation
          proceeds received;
     o    At a  mark-to-market  price,  if the loans are not  delinquent and are
          standard Farmer Mac loan products;
     o    At a  mark-to-market  negotiated price for all (but not some) loans in
          the pool, if they are not four months delinquent; or
     o    In exchange for Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities.

As of March 31, 2003 and  December  31, 2002,  the maximum  principal  amount of
potential  undiscounted  future  payments  that Farmer Mac could be requested to
make under LTSPCs,  not including  offsets provided by any recourse  provisions,
recoveries from third parties or collateral for the underlying  loans,  was $2.7
billion and $2.7 billion, respectively.

     If requested to purchase the  underlying  loans,  Farmer Mac would have the
right to enforce the terms of the loans, and in the event of loan default, would
have the right to foreclose upon the underlying collateral.  To date, Farmer Mac
has not incurred any  charge-offs on LTSPCs.  However,  Farmer Mac believes that
the credit  risk  assumed in LTSPC  transactions  is the same as the credit risk
assumed on Post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities. Farmer Mac believes
that it will  generally  recover  a  significant  portion  of the  value  of the
defaulted  loans  purchased  either  through  borrower  payments,  loan payoffs,
payments by third parties or foreclosure and sale of the collateral.

     As of March 31, 2003, the weighted-average  remaining maturity of all loans
underlying LTSPCs was 15.5 years. For the LTSPCs that were executed on or before
December 31, 2002, Farmer Mac has recorded an allowance for probable losses that
was $12.4  million as of March 31,  2003 and $11.4  million as of  December  31,
2002. For those LTSPCs that were issued or modified on or after January 1, 2003,
Farmer Mac has  recorded the fair value of its  obligation  to stand ready under
the commitment as a liability. As of March 31, 2003, this liability approximated
$2.0 million and was included in other liabilities on the condensed consolidated
balance sheet.

Note 3.  Comprehensive Income (Loss)

     Comprehensive  income  (loss) is comprised of net income plus other changes
in  stockholders'  equity not resulting from  investments by or distributions to
stockholders. The following table sets forth comprehensive income (loss) for the
three months ended March 31, 2003 and 2002. For the three months ended March 31,
2003 and 2002, the changes in unrealized gains on securities  available-for-sale
are  net of the  related  deferred  taxes  of $1.7  million  and  $4.5  million,
respectively.  The  changes  in the  fair  value  of the  financial  derivatives
classified  as cash flow  hedges for the three  months  ended March 31, 2003 and
2002 are net of deferred taxes of $0.6 million and $1.7 million, respectively.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
        of Operations


Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

     Certain statements made in this Form 10-Q are "forward-looking  statements"
within  the  meaning of the  Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform Act of 1995
pertaining  to  management's  current  expectations  as to Farmer  Mac's  future
financial results, business prospects and business developments. Forward-looking
statements  include,  without  limitation,   any  statement  that  may  predict,
forecast,  indicate or imply future results,  performance or  achievements,  and
typically are accompanied by, and identified with, such terms as  "anticipates,"
"believes,"  "expects,"  "intends," "should" and similar phrases.  The following
management's  discussion  and  analysis  includes   forward-looking   statements
addressing  Farmer Mac's  prospects  for  earnings and growth in loan  purchase,
guarantee,  LTSPC and securitization  volume;  trends in net interest income and
provision  for  losses;  changes in capital  position;  and other  business  and
financial matters.

     Management's  expectations  for Farmer Mac's future  necessarily  involve a
number of assumptions,  estimates and the evaluation of risks and uncertainties.
Various  factors  could cause Farmer  Mac's  actual  results or events to differ
materially from the expectations as expressed or implied by the  forward-looking
statements, including uncertainties regarding:

     o    the rate and  direction of  development  of the  secondary  market for
          agricultural mortgage loans;
     o    the possible  establishment of additional  regulatory  restrictions or
          requirements on Farmer Mac by the Farm Credit  Administration  ("FCA")
          or other government agencies;
     o    legislative or regulatory  developments or  interpretations  of Farmer
          Mac's statutory  charter that could adversely affect Farmer Mac or the
          ability of certain lenders to participate in its programs or the terms
          of any such participation;
     o    substantial  changes in  interest  rates,  agricultural  land  values,
          commodity prices, export demand for U.S. agricultural products and the
          general economy;
     o    protracted  adverse  weather,  market  or other  conditions  affecting
          particular  geographic  regions or particular  commodities  related to
          agricultural mortgage loans backing Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities
          or under LTSPCs;
     o    Farmer Mac's continuing  access to the debt markets at favorable rates
          and terms;
     o    the possible effect of the risk-based capital requirement which could,
          under certain  circumstances,  be in excess of the  statutory  minimum
          capital  level;
     o    the  outcome  of the  pending  review  of  Farmer  Mac by the  General
          Accounting Office;
     o    the rate of growth in agricultural mortgage indebtedness;
     o    borrower    preferences   for   fixed-rate    agricultural    mortgage
          indebtedness;
     o    competition in the  origination or purchase of  agricultural  mortgage
          loans  and  the  sale  of   agricultural   mortgage-backed   and  debt
          securities; or
     o    the  effects on the  agricultural  economy  of any  changes in federal
          assistance for agriculture.

     The foregoing factors are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report may
include additional factors that could adversely affect Farmer Mac's business and
its financial  performance.  Furthermore,  new risk factors  emerge from time to
time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor
assess the  effects of such  factors on Farmer  Mac's  business or the extent to
which any factor, or combination of factors,  may cause actual results to differ
materially  from the  expectations  expressed or implied by the  forward-looking
statements.  In light of  these  potential  risks  and  uncertainties,  no undue
reliance should be placed on any  forward-looking  statements  expressed in this
report. Furthermore, Farmer Mac undertakes no obligation to release publicly the
results  of  revisions  to any  forward-looking  statements  that may be made to
reflect any future events or circumstances  except as otherwise  mandated by the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

      The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires the
use of estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the
consolidated financial statements and related notes for the periods presented.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. The critical accounting policy
that is both important to the portrayal of Farmer Mac's financial condition and
results of operations and requires complex, subjective judgments is the
accounting policy for the allowance for losses. The allowance for losses is
presented in three components on the consolidated balance sheet:

     o    an "Allowance for loan losses" on loans held for investment;
     o    a valuation  allowance on real estate owned,  which is included in the
          balance sheet under "Real estate owned (net of valuation  allowance)";
          and
     o    an allowance for losses on loans underlying Post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I
          Guaranteed  Securities  and  LTSPCs,  which is included in the balance
          sheet under "Reserve for losses."

     The purpose of the allowance for losses is to provide for estimated  losses
that are  probable to have  occurred as of the  balance  sheet date,  and not to
predict or  account  for  future  potential  losses.  The  determination  of the
allowance for losses requires management to make significant  estimates based on
information  available as of the balance  sheet date,  including the amounts and
timing of losses and current market and economic conditions. These estimates are
subject to change in future reporting periods if such conditions and information
change.  For  example,  a  continued  decline in the  national  or  agricultural
economies could result in an increase in delinquencies  or  foreclosures,  which
may require additional allowances for losses in future periods.

     Farmer Mac  maintains an allowance for losses to cover  estimated  probable
losses on its loans held, real estate owned and loans  underlying  Post-1996 Act
Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities and LTSPCs.  In estimating  probable losses,
management  considers the results of its  proprietary  loan pool  simulation and
guarantee  fee model.  Those  results  may be  modified  by the  application  of
management's   judgment  that  takes  into  account  factors  such  as  economic
conditions, geographic and agricultural commodity concentrations of Farmer Mac's
portfolio,  the  credit  profile  of the  portfolio,  delinquency  trends of the
portfolio and historical  charge-offs and recovery  activities of the portfolio.
The allowance is increased through periodic  provisions for loan losses that are
charged  against net interest  income and provisions for losses that are charged
to  operating  expense  and reduced by  charge-offs  for actual  losses,  net of
recoveries.

     No  allowance  for losses has been made for loans  underlying  Farmer Mac I
Guaranteed  Securities  issued prior to the 1996 Act or Farmer Mac II Guaranteed
Securities.  Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities issued prior to the 1996 Act are
supported by unguaranteed first loss subordinated interests,  which are expected
to exceed the estimated credit losses on those loans.  USDA-guaranteed  portions
collateralizing  Farmer Mac II Guaranteed  Securities are obligations  backed by
the full  faith  and  credit  of the  United  States.  To date,  Farmer  Mac has
experienced no losses on any pre-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities or
on any Farmer Mac II Guaranteed Securities and does not expect to incur any such
losses in the future.

     Further  information  regarding  the  allowance  for losses is  included in
"--Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Management--Credit
Risk."

Results of Operations

     Overview.  Net income  available to common  stockholders  for first quarter
2003,  was $8.4  million or $0.70 per  diluted  common  share,  compared to $7.2
million or $0.59 per diluted common share for first quarter 2002.

     Farmer Mac's revenue growth continued in first quarter 2003, reflecting the
effects of outstanding guarantee and commitment volume as of March 31, 2003 that
was more than $1.1  billion  higher than at the close of first  quarter 2002 and
increased net interest income. During first quarter 2003, Farmer Mac:

     o    added $166.6 million of Farmer Mac I eligible loans under LTSPCs;
     o    purchased  $59.1  million  of newly  originated  Farmer Mac I eligible
          loans; and
     o    purchased $41.9 million of Farmer Mac II guaranteed  portions of loans
          guaranteed by USDA.

     USDA is currently forecasting net cash income on farms for 2003 to be $51.3
billion,  up 11  percent  from  2002  forecasted  levels of $46.3  billion.  The
forecasted  net cash income on farms for 2003  includes  government  payments of
$17.6 billion, as compared to $13.1 billion in 2002, and increases in total crop
and  livestock  receipts.  USDA  forecasts  farm real  estate  values to rise by
approximately  1.5 percent in 2003,  slowing  slightly  from their growth of 4.0
percent in 2002, 5.2 percent in 2001, and 6.8 percent in 2000. On average,  farm
real  estate  values  grew  nearly  4.0  percent   annually  during  the  1990s.
Regionally,  farm real estate values may vary with differing  rates of increase,
or even  decrease,  depending  on  differences  in land  quality  and  location,
commodities  grown,  credit  conditions,   non-farm  investment   opportunities,
government farm policies,  and production risks and weather uncertainties unique
to each region's agriculture.

     Set forth below is a more  detailed  discussion  of Farmer Mac's results of
operations.

     Net Interest Income. Net interest income was $9.5 million for first quarter
2003,  compared to $7.5 million for first quarter 2002. The net interest  yield,
which does not include guarantee fees for loans purchased prior to April 1, 2001
(the  effective  date of Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 140,
Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial  Assets and  Extinguishments
of  Liabilities  ("SFAS  140")),  was 95 basis  points for first  quarter  2003,
compared to 89 basis points for first quarter 2002. The net interest  yields for
first quarter 2003 and 2002 included the benefits of yield maintenance  payments
of 14 basis points and 7 basis points,  respectively.  The income  realized from
yield maintenance  payments is, in effect,  the accelerated  present value of an
expected  future  interest  income  stream,  which,  in turn,  leads to slightly
reduced net interest income in future reporting periods.  Because the timing and
size of  these  payments  vary  greatly,  variations  should  not be  considered
indicative of positive or negative trends to gauge future financial results. The
effect of the adoption of SFAS 140 was a reclassification  of approximately $1.1
million (11 basis points) of guarantee  fee income as interest  income for first
quarter 2003, compared to an immaterial amount for first quarter 2002.

     The following table provides information regarding the average balances and
rates of  interest-earning  assets and funding for the three  months ended March
31, 2003 and 2002. The balance of non-accruing  loans is included in the average
balance  of  interest  earning  loans  presented,  though no  related  income is
included in the income figures presented. The decreases in the average rates for
cash and cash equivalents  reflect their short-term nature. The decreases in the
average rates for  investments  and loans and Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities
reflect the  relatively  large  proportion  of  adjustable  rates in those asset
categories (78.0 percent of investments and 64.1 percent of loans and Farmer Mac
Guaranteed Securities). The decrease in the average rate for discount notes also
reflects their short-term  nature. The decreases in all of these rates track the
general decrease in market rates between the two periods.

     The  following  table sets forth  information  regarding the changes in the
components of Farmer Mac's net interest  income for the periods  indicated.  For
each  category,  information is provided on changes  attributable  to changes in
volume (change in volume  multiplied by old rate) and changes in rate (change in
rate  multiplied  by old  volume).  Combined  rate/volume  variances,  the third
element of the  calculation,  are allocated  based on their  relative  size. The
decreases due to rate reflect the  short-term or  adjustable-rate  nature of the
assets or liabilities and the general decreases in market rates described above.

</TABLE>

     Guarantee and  Commitment  Fees.  Guarantee and  commitment  fees were $5.1
million for first quarter 2003, compared to $4.6 million for first quarter 2002.
The  increase  in  guarantee  and  commitment  fees  reflects an increase in the
average balance of outstanding  guarantees and LTSPCs.  Excluding the effects of
the adoption of SFAS 140 that  reclassified $1.1 million of guarantee fee income
as interest  income,  guarantee and commitment fees for first quarter 2003 would
have been $6.2 million.  The  difference or "spread"  between the cost of Farmer
Mac's  debt  funding  for  loans  and  Post-1996  Act  Farmer  Mac I  Guaranteed
Securities  held on its books and the yield on those  assets is  composed of one
component that  compensates for credit risk, which would continue to be received
by Farmer Mac as a guarantee fee if the assets were sold, and another  component
that compensates for interest rate risk,  which would not typically  continue to
be  received by Farmer Mac (except to the extent  attributable  to any  retained
interest-only strip) if the asset were sold.

     Miscellaneous income was $0.3 million for first quarter 2003, compared to
$0.4 million for first quarter 2002.

     Expenses.  Compensation  and employee  benefits for first quarter 2003 were
$1.4 million,  compared to $1.3 million for first quarter 2002.  Regulatory fees
assessed  by FCA for first  quarter  2003 were $0.4  million,  compared  to $0.2
million for first quarter 2002.  General and  administrative  expenses for first
quarter 2003 were $1.2 million, compared to $1.1 million for first quarter 2002.
Farmer Mac expects that general and administrative costs, including professional
fees,  will remain at higher  than  historical  levels as a result of  increased
costs to ensure  compliance  with the new statutory and regulatory  requirements
relating to corporate governance.

     Farmer Mac's  provision for losses was $0.9 million for first quarter 2003,
compared to $2.0  million  for first  quarter  2002.  (See  "--Quantitative  and
Qualitative   Disclosures  About  Market  Risk   Management--Credit   Risk"  for
additional information regarding Farmer Mac's provision for losses and provision
for loan losses.) As of March 31, 2003,  Farmer Mac's total allowance for losses
totaled  $21.1  million,  or 0.44  percent  of  outstanding  loans held or loans
underlying Post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs, compared
to $20.0 million (0.42 percent) as of December 31, 2002.

     Gain on the  Repurchase  of  Debt.  For  first  quarter  2002,  Farmer  Mac
recognized  a gain of  $2.5  million  on the  repurchase  of  $43.8  million  of
outstanding  Farmer Mac debt that had a maturity date of October 14, 2011 and an
annual  interest  rate of 5.4  percent.  Prior  to the  adoption  of SFAS 145 on
January 1, 2003, this gain was presented as a net after-tax  extraordinary  gain
of $1.6 million. These debt securities were replaced with new fixed-rate funding
to the same maturity dates at more attractive  interest  rates,  which preserves
Farmer Mac's  asset-liability  match and reduces future interest expense.  There
were no gains or losses on the repurchase of debt during first quarter 2003.

     Gains on Financial  Derivatives and Trading Assets. For first quarter 2003,
the gain on financial  derivatives and trading assets resulting from the effects
of SFAS 133 was $3.8  million,  compared to $0.2 million for first quarter 2002.
The gains resulted  primarily from increases in the fair values of interest rate
contracts.

     Non-GAAP Performance Measures.  Farmer Mac reports its financial results in
accordance with GAAP. In addition to GAAP measures,  Farmer Mac presents certain
non-GAAP performance  measures.  These non-GAAP performance measures are used by
Farmer Mac to develop financial plans, to measure Corporate performance,  and to
set incentive compensation.  In management's view, the non-GAAP measures provide
relatively  less  volatile  financial  information,  and  are  a  more  accurate
representation of Farmer Mac's financial performance,  transaction economics and
business trends.  Investors and the investment analyst community have previously
relied upon  similar  measures to evaluate  performance  and issue  projections.
These  disclosures are not intended to replace GAAP information but, rather,  to
supplement it.

     One such measure is core  earnings,  which Farmer Mac  developed to present
net income less the  after-tax  effects of SFAS 133, and less the  after-tax net
gains and losses on the repurchase of debt that,  prior to January 1, 2003, were
reported as extraordinary  items. Core earnings for first quarter 2003 were $5.9
million,  compared to $5.3 million for first quarter 2002. The reconciliation of
GAAP net income  available to common  stockholders to core earnings is presented
in the following table:

     Business  Volume.  Farmer Mac purchases  eligible loans or  USDA-guaranteed
portions of loans,  securitizes  those loans and guarantees  timely  payments of
principal  and  interest on  securities  backed by those  loans.  Farmer Mac may
retain those  securities in its portfolio or sell them to third parties  through
the capital  markets.  Farmer Mac also enters into LTSPCs for eligible loans and
exchanges  of  Farmer  Mac   Guaranteed   Securities   for  eligible   loans  or
USDA-guaranteed  portions of loans ("swaps").  Loans are brought into the Farmer
Mac I and Farmer Mac II programs as follows:

     o    Farmer Mac's  purchases of eligible loans and guarantees of securities
          backed by those  loans are part of the Farmer  Mac I program  (whether
          the securities are retained by Farmer Mac or sold);
     o    Farmer  Mac's  purchases  of  USDA-guaranteed  portions  of loans  and
          guarantees of securities backed by those guaranteed  portions are part
          of the Farmer Mac II program  (whether the  securities are retained by
          Farmer Mac or sold);
     o    Farmer Mac's  commitments  through  LTSPCs,  which may include  either
          newly  originated or seasoned  eligible loans,  are part of the Farmer
          Mac I program; and
     o    Farmer   Mac's  swaps  of  Farmer  Mac   Guaranteed   Securities   for
          USDA-guaranteed  portions  of  loans  are  part of the  Farmer  Mac II
          program and Farmer Mac swaps of Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities for
          any other eligible loans are included in the Farmer Mac I program.

     The  following  table  sets forth the amount of all Farmer Mac I and Farmer
Mac II loan purchase and guarantee  activities for newly  originated and current
seasoned loans during the periods indicated.

     The purchase  price of newly  originated  and seasoned  eligible  loans and
portfolios purchased by Farmer Mac (none of which were delinquent at the time of
purchase) is the fair value based on current  market  interest  rates and Farmer
Mac's target net yield,  which  includes an amount to compensate  Farmer Mac for
credit risk that is similar to the guarantee or  commitment  fee it receives for
accepting credit risk on loans underlying  Post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed
Securities  and LTSPCs.  As part of  fulfilling  its guarantee  obligations  for
Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities and assumption of credit risk on commitments
to purchase  eligible loans underlying  LTSPCs,  Farmer Mac purchases  defaulted
loans (all of which are at least 90 days delinquent at the time of purchase) out
of those  securities and pools. The purchase price for defaulted loans purchased
out of Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities is the current outstanding  principal
balance of the loan plus accrued and unpaid  interest.  The  purchase  price for
defaulted loans purchased  under an LTSPC is the current  outstanding  principal
balance of the loan,  with accrued and unpaid  interest on the  defaulted  loans
payable out of any future loan payments or liquidation  proceeds  received.  The
following  table presents  Farmer Mac's loan  purchases of newly  originated and
current  seasoned loans and defaulted  loans purchased  underlying  Farmer Mac I
Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs.

</TABLE>


     The decrease in newly  originated  and current  seasoned loan purchases was
attributable to a decrease in newly originated Farmer Mac I loan purchases.  The
combined   increase  in  defaulted   loans  purchased  and  in  defaulted  loans
transferred to loans reflect:
     o    Farmer Mac's  practice of purchasing  90-day  delinquent  loans out of
          Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities; and
     o    recordation in the  consolidated  financial  statements of other loans
          over which Farmer Mac regained effective control during the period.

With respect to the second circumstance cited, when particular criteria are met,
such as the default of the borrower, Farmer Mac becomes entitled to exercise its
option to purchase the defaulted loans underlying Farmer Mac Guaranteed
Securities (these options are commonly referred to as "removal-of-account"
provisions). Farmer Mac records these loans in the consolidated financial
statements during the period in which Farmer Mac has the option to repurchase
the loans and therefore regains effective control over the transferred loans.

     The  weighted-average  age of the Farmer Mac I newly originated and current
seasoned  loans  purchased  during first quarter 2003 and first quarter 2002 was
1.8 months and 2.3 months,  respectively.  Of the Farmer Mac I newly  originated
and current seasoned loans purchased during first quarter 2003 and first quarter
2002,  77 percent  and 24  percent,  respectively,  had  principal  amortization
periods  longer  than the  maturity  date,  resulting  in  balloon  payments  at
maturity,  with a weighted-average  remaining term to maturity of 15.3 years and
13.8 years, respectively. The weighted-average age of delinquent loans purchased
out of securitized  pools and LTSPCs during first quarter 2003 and first quarter
2002 was 4.8 years and 4.1 years, respectively.

     Indicators of future loan purchase and guarantee  volume (but not of future
LTSPC,  swap  or  portfolio  purchase  volume)  in  the  immediately  succeeding
reporting period include  outstanding  commitments to purchase loans (other than
under an  LTSPC)  and the total  balance  of loans  submitted  for  approval  or
approved but not yet purchased. Many purchase commitments entered into by Farmer
Mac  are  mandatory  delivery  commitments.  If a  seller  obtains  a  mandatory
commitment and is unable to deliver the loans as required thereunder, Farmer Mac
requires the seller to pay a fee to modify, extend or cancel the commitment.  As
of March 31,  2003,  outstanding  commitments  to  purchase  Farmer  Mac I loans
totaled  $15.1  million,  compared to $18.6 million as of March 31, 2002. Of the
total Farmer Mac I commitments  outstanding as of March 31, 2003 and 2002,  $5.8
million  and $4.3  million,  respectively,  were  mandatory  commitments.  Loans
submitted  for  approval or approved but not yet  committed to purchase  totaled
$67.3  million as of March 31, 2003,  compared to $82.9  million as of March 31,
2002.  Not all of these  loans will be  purchased,  as some will  ultimately  be
denied for credit reasons or withdrawn by the seller.

     While significant progress has been made in developing the secondary market
for  agricultural  mortgages,  Farmer Mac  continues to face the  challenges  of
establishing a market where none previously existed.  Acceptance of Farmer Mac's
programs is increasing among lenders,  reflecting the competitive  rates,  terms
and  products  offered  and the  advantages  Farmer Mac  believes  its  programs
provide.  As of March 31, 2003, Farmer Mac's outstanding program volume was $5.5
billion,  which represented  approximately 12% of management's estimate of a $46
billion  market of  eligible  agricultural  mortgage  loans.  For  Farmer Mac to
succeed in realizing its business development and profitability  objectives over
the longer term, the use of Farmer Mac's  programs and products by  agricultural
mortgage  lenders,  whether  traditional  or  non-traditional,  must continue to
expand.  New business volume was down in first quarter 2003. Farmer Mac believes
this is traceable to general  conditions  in the  agricultural  mortgage  market
affecting all agricultural  mortgage lenders,  including the reduced interest of
borrowers in long-term fixed rate financing, diminished expansion in the capital
intensive  livestock sector, and a slowdown in the capital intensive planting of
permanent  crops, as well as to residual  effects of adverse  publicity based on
misinformation about Farmer Mac disseminated in 2002. Nonetheless,  while lender
interest  in Farmer Mac  continues  to recover,  for 2003 Farmer Mac  foresees a
continuation  in the  flow of new  volume  in the  form of  Farmer  Mac I and II
individual loan purchases and additions to existing LTSPC arrangements at levels
approximating  those of 2002.  Farmer Mac  believes  that  prospects  for larger
portfolio  transactions  similar to those that have  accounted for a significant
portion of growth in prior years  continue  to exist,  but no  assurance  can be
given at this time as to the certainty of such transactions.

     As of March 31, 2003, there were 71 approved loan sellers in the Farmer Mac
I program  ranging from  single-office  to multi-branch  institutions,  spanning
community banks,  Farm Credit System  associations,  mortgage  companies,  large
multi-state Farm Credit System banks,  commercial banks and insurance companies.
During  2002,  there were 79 approved  loan  sellers  active in the Farmer Mac I
program.

     To be  considered  for  approval  as a Farmer  Mac I  seller,  a  financial
institution must meet criteria established by Farmer Mac, including:

     o    own a requisite  amount of Farmer Mac Class A or Class B voting common
          stock  according  to a  schedule  prescribed  for the size and type of
          institution;
     o    have  the  ability  and  experience  to  make  or  purchase  and  sell
          agricultural mortgage loans of the type that will qualify for purchase
          by Farmer Mac and service such mortgage  loans in accordance  with the
          Farmer  Mac  requirements  either  through  its own  staff or  through
          contractors and originators;
     o    maintain a minimum adjusted net worth of $1.0 million;
     o    maintain a fidelity bond and errors and omissions  insurance  coverage
          (or acceptable  substitute  insurance coverage) in a prescribed amount
          according to the size of the institution; and
     o    enter into a Seller/Servicer agreement to comply with the terms of the
          Farmer  Mac  Seller/Servicer  Guide,  including   representations  and
          warranties regarding the origination of eligible loans.

     Any lender  authorized by the USDA to obtain a USDA guarantee on a loan may
be a seller in the Farmer Mac II program.  As of March 31, 2003,  there were 132
active sellers in the Farmer Mac II program,  compared to 143 as of December 31,
2002 and 130 as of March 31, 2002.  Sellers in the Farmer Mac II program consist
mostly of community and regional banks.

Balance Sheet Review

     During the three  months ended March 31,  2003,  total assets  decreased by
$28.5 million from December 31, 2002,  with  decreases in program assets (Farmer
Mac Guaranteed  Securities and loans) of $36.4 million (exclusive of real estate
owned)  partially  offset  by  increases  in  non-program  assets.  For  further
information  regarding  on-  and  off-balance  sheet  program  activities,   see
"--Off-Balance Sheet Program Activities" below.  Consistent with the decrease in
total assets  during the period,  total  liabilities  decreased by $34.9 million
from December 31, 2002 to March 31, 2003.

     During  the  three  months  ended  March  31,   2003,   accumulated   other
comprehensive income (loss) decreased $2.0 million, which is the net effect of a
$3.1 million decrease in unrealized gains on securities available for sale and a
$1.1 million increase in the fair value of financial  derivatives  classified as
cash  flow  hedges.  Accumulated  other  comprehensive  income  (loss)  is not a
component of Farmer Mac's core capital or regulatory capital.

     As of March 31, 2003,  Farmer Mac's core capital  totaled  $192.4  million,
compared to $184.0  million as of December 31, 2002. As of March 31, 2003,  core
capital  exceeded Farmer Mac's statutory  minimum capital  requirement of $136.5
million by $55.9 million.

     FCA issued its final risk-based  capital regulation for Farmer Mac on April
12,  2001  and the  Corporation  was  required  to meet the  risk-based  capital
standards  beginning  on May  23,  2002.  The  risk-based  capital  stress  test
promulgated  by FCA is intended to determine  the amount of  regulatory  capital
(core capital plus  allowance for losses) that Farmer Mac would need to maintain
positive capital during a ten-year period in which:

     o    annual  losses  occur at  a rate of default and  severity  "reasonably
          related" to the rates of the highest sequential two years in a limited
          U.S. geographic area; and

     o    there is an  initial  interest  rate  shock at the lesser of 600 basis
          points or 50 percent of the ten-year U.S.  Treasury rate, and interest
          rates remain at such level for the remainder of the period.

The  risk-based  capital  stress test then adds an  additional 30 percent to the
resulting capital requirement for management and operational risk.

     Farmer Mac was in compliance  with the risk-based  capital  standards under
the  regulation  as of March 31,  2003.  As of March 31,  2003,  the  risk-based
capital stress test generated a regulatory capital requirement of $57.9 million.
Farmer  Mac's  regulatory  capital of $213.5  million  exceeded  that  amount by
approximately $155.6 million. The decrease in the risk-based capital requirement
from December 31, 2002 ($73.4  million) to March 31, 2003 ($57.9  million) was a
result of  changes in the  interest  rate  environment  and the ageing of Farmer
Mac's loan  portfolio.  Farmer Mac is required to hold  capital at the higher of
the  statutory  minimum  capital  requirement  or  the  amount  required  by the
risk-based capital stress test.

Off-Balance Sheet Program Activities

     Farmer Mac offers  approved  agricultural  and rural  residential  mortgage
lenders two  off-balance  sheet  alternatives  to increase  their  liquidity  or
lending  capacity  while  retaining the cash flow  benefits of their loans:  (1)
Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities,  which are available through either the Farmer
Mac I program or the Farmer Mac II program,  and (2) LTSPCs, which are available
only through the Farmer Mac I program. To be eligible for Farmer Mac I secondary
market  transactions,  a  loan  must  meet  Farmer  Mac's  credit  underwriting,
appraisal  and  documentation  standards.  Accordingly,  Farmer Mac believes the
credit risk it assumes in each of the two Farmer Mac I transaction  alternatives
is the  same  and  considers  the  effects  of all  on-  and  off-balance  sheet
activities on its overall portfolio  diversification and credit risk. See Note 2
to Farmer  Mac's  condensed  consolidated  financial  statements  above for more
detail on the Corporation's off-balance sheet program activities.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Management

     Interest  Rate Risk.  Farmer Mac is  subject to  interest  rate risk on all
assets held for investment  because of possible  timing  differences in the cash
flows of the assets and related  liabilities.  This risk is primarily related to
loans held and  Farmer  Mac  Guaranteed  Securities  because  of the  ability of
borrowers to prepay their  mortgages  before the scheduled  maturities,  thereby
increasing  the risk of asset  and  liability  cash flow  mismatches.  Cash flow
mismatches in a changing  interest rate  environment  can reduce the earnings of
the  Corporation  if assets repay sooner than  expected and the  resulting  cash
flows must be reinvested in lower-yielding investments when Farmer Mac's funding
costs  cannot be  correspondingly  reduced,  or if assets repay more slowly than
expected and the associated debt must be replaced by higher-cost debt.

     Yield maintenance  provisions and other prepayment  penalties  contained in
many agricultural mortgage loans reduce, but do not eliminate,  this risk. Those
provisions  require  borrowers  to make an  additional  payment when they prepay
their  loans,  so that,  when  reinvested  with  the  prepaid  principal,  yield
maintenance payments generate  substantially the same cash flows that would have
been generated had the loan not prepaid.  Those provisions create a disincentive
to prepayment and in the event of prepayment, compensate the Corporation for its
interest rate risks to a large  degree.  As of March 31, 2003, 55 percent of the
outstanding  balance of all loans  held and loans  underlying  on-balance  sheet
Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities (including 90 percent of all loans with fixed
interest  rates)  were  covered  by  yield  maintenance   provisions  and  other
prepayment  penalties.  Of the Farmer Mac I new and current  loans  purchased in
first  quarter  2003,  10  percent  had yield  maintenance  or  another  form of
prepayment  protection  (including  37 percent of all loans with fixed  interest
rates). None of the USDA-guaranteed portions underlying Farmer Mac II Guaranteed
Securities had yield maintenance provisions.

     The goal of  interest  rate risk  management  at Farmer  Mac is to create a
portfolio that generates  stable earnings and value across a variety of interest
rate environments. Farmer Mac's primary strategy for managing interest rate risk
is to fund asset purchases with liabilities that have similar  durations so that
they will perform  similarly as interest  rates  change.  To achieve this match,
Farmer Mac issues discount notes and both callable and non-callable  medium-term
notes across a spectrum of maturities  and purchases  financial  derivatives  to
alter the duration of its liabilities and so its interest rate sensitivities. By
using a blend of  liabilities  that includes  callable  debt,  the interest rate
sensitivities  of the liabilities tend to increase or decrease as interest rates
change in a manner similar to changes in the interest rate  sensitivities of the
assets.

     Farmer Mac's $685.8  million of cash and cash  equivalents  as of March 31,
2003 matures within three months and are match-funded with discount notes having
similar maturities. Investment securities of $887.3 million as of March 31, 2003
consist of $691.8  million (78.0 percent) of floating rate  securities  that all
have rates that adjust  within one year.  These  floating rate  investments  are
funded using a series of discount note issuances.  Each successive discount note
issuance  matures on or about the  corresponding  repricing  date of the related
investment.

     Farmer Mac is also subject to interest rate risk on loans,  including loans
that Farmer Mac has committed to acquire but has not yet purchased.  When Farmer
Mac commits to purchase a loan,  it is exposed to interest rate risk between the
time it commits to purchase the loan and the time it either:

     o    sells Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities backed by the loan; or
     o    issues debt to retain the loan in its portfolio (although issuing debt
          to fund the loan as an investment  does not fully  eliminate  interest
          rate risk due to the possible timing  differences in the cash flows of
          the assets and related liabilities, as discussed above).

Farmer Mac manages the interest rate risk related to such loans, and any related
Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities or debt  issuance,  through the use of forward
sale   contracts   on  the  debt  and   mortgage-backed   securities   of  other
government-sponsored  enterprises and futures contracts  involving U.S. Treasury
securities.  Farmer Mac uses  forward  sale  contracts  on  government-sponsored
enterprise  securities  to reduce its interest  rate exposure to changes in both
Treasury  rates and  spreads  on Farmer  Mac debt and  Farmer  Mac I  Guaranteed
Securities.

     Since interest rate  sensitivity may change with the passage of time and as
interest rates change,  Farmer Mac assesses this exposure on a regular basis and
rebalances its portfolio of assets and liabilities as necessary through:

     o    purchasing mortgage assets in the ordinary course of business;
     o    refunding existing liabilities; or
     o    using derivatives to alter the  characteristics  of existing assets or
          liabilities.

     The most  strenuous  measure  of  Farmer  Mac's  interest  rate risk is the
sensitivity  of its Market  Value of Equity  ("MVE")  to  parallel  yield  curve
shocks.  MVE  represents the present value of all future cash flows from on- and
off-balance sheet assets,  liabilities and financial derivatives,  discounted at
current  interest  rates and spreads.  The  following  schedule  summarizes  the
results  of  Farmer  Mac's MVE  sensitivity  analysis  as of March 31,  2003 and
December 31, 2002 to an immediate and instantaneous  parallel shift in the yield
curve.

</TABLE>


     During 2002 and first  quarter 2003,  interest  rates fell to historic lows
and  interest  rate  volatility  increased  significantly.  Despite the volatile
interest rate environment,  Farmer Mac's interest rate sensitivity  during first
quarter 2003  remained  relatively  stable and at relatively  low levels.  As of
March 31, 2003, Farmer Mac's effective duration gap, another standard measure of
interest rate risk, decreased to minus 3.0 months,  compared to minus 3.6 months
as of December 31, 2002. As of both March 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, Farmer
Mac's  MVE and net  interest  income  ("NII")  showed  positive  sensitivity  to
increasing  interest rates and negative  sensitivity  to continued  decreases in
interest rates.

     As of March 31, 2003, a uniform or "parallel"  increase of 100 basis points
would have increased  NII, a shorter-term  measure of interest rate risk, by 5.2
percent,  while a parallel decrease of 100 basis points would have decreased NII
by 5.7 percent.  Farmer Mac also measures the sensitivity of both MVE and NII to
a variety  of  non-parallel  interest  rate  shocks,  including  flattening  and
steepening yield curve scenarios. Both MVE and NII continue to be less sensitive
to non-parallel  shocks than to the parallel  shocks.  The sensitivity of Farmer
Mac's MVE and NII to both parallel and  non-parallel  interest rate shocks,  and
its duration gap, indicate the  effectiveness of the  Corporation's  approach to
managing its interest rate risk exposures.

     The economic  effects of financial  derivatives,  including  interest  rate
swaps,  are  included in the MVE,  NII and  duration  gap  analyses.  Farmer Mac
generally  enters into various  interest rate swaps to reduce interest rate risk
as follows:

     o    "floating-to-fixed  interest  rate swaps" in which it pays fixed rates
          of  interest  to,  and  receives  floating  rates  of  interest  from,
          counterparties;  these swaps adjust the  characteristics of short-term
          debt to match more closely the cash flow and duration  characteristics
          of  longer-term  reset and  fixed-rate  mortgages and other assets and
          provide  an  overall  lower  effective  cost of  borrowing  than would
          otherwise be available in the conventional debt market;
     o    "fixed-to-floating  interest  rate swaps" in which it  receives  fixed
          rates of  interest  from,  and pays  floating  rates of  interest  to,
          counterparties;  these swaps adjust the  characteristics  of long-term
          debt to match more closely the cash flow and duration  characteristics
          of short-term assets; and
     o    "basis swaps" in which it pays variable rates of interest based on one
          index to, and  receives  variable  rates of interest  based on another
          index from, counterparties; these swaps alter interest rate indices of
          liabilities to match those of assets, and vice versa.

As of March 31, 2003,  Farmer Mac had $1.187 billion combined notional amount of
interest  rate  swaps with terms  ranging  from one month to 15 years.  Of those
interest rate swaps,  $726.6 million were  floating-to-fixed  rate interest rate
swaps, $360.5 million were basis swaps and $100.0 million were fixed-to-floating
interest rate swaps.

     Farmer Mac uses financial  derivatives as an end-user for hedging purposes,
not for trading or speculative  purposes.  When financial  derivatives  meet the
specific  hedge  criteria  under SFAS 133, they are accounted for as either fair
value  hedges or cash flow  hedges.  Financial  derivatives  that do not satisfy
those hedge  criteria  are not  accounted  for as hedges and changes in the fair
value of those financial derivatives are reported as a gain or loss on financial
derivatives  and trading  assets in the statement of  operations.  All of Farmer
Mac's   financial   derivative   transactions   are  conducted   under  standard
collateralized  agreements that limit Farmer Mac's potential  credit exposure to
any counterparty.  As of March 31, 2003, Farmer Mac had no uncollateralized  net
exposure to any counterparty.

     Credit Risk.  Farmer Mac's  primary  exposure to credit risk is the risk of
loss resulting from the inability of borrowers to repay their mortgages.  Farmer
Mac is exposed to credit risk on:

     o    loans it holds;
     o    loans underlying Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities; and
     o    loans underlying LTSPCs.

Loans held or loans underlying Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities or LTSPCs can be
divided into four groups:

     o    loans held for investment;
     o    loans underlying pre-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities;
     o    loans underlying  Post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities or
          LTSPCs; and
     o    USDA-guaranteed   portions   underlying   Farmer  Mac  II   Guaranteed
          Securities.

     For loans underlying pre-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities,  ten
percent  first-loss  subordinated  interests  mitigate  Farmer Mac's credit risk
exposure.  Before  Farmer Mac incurs a credit loss,  full recourse must first be
taken  against  the   subordinated   interest.   The  1996  Act  eliminated  the
subordinated interest requirement. As a result, Farmer Mac generally assumes 100
percent of the credit  risk on loans held for  investment  and loans  underlying
Post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs. Farmer Mac's credit
exposure on USDA-guaranteed  portions is covered by the full faith and credit of
the United States.  Farmer Mac believes it has little or no credit risk exposure
to loans underlying  pre-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities because of
the subordinated interests,  or to USDA-guaranteed  portions because of the USDA
guarantee.  The outstanding principal balance of loans held and loans underlying
Farmer  Mac  Guaranteed  Securities  (including  AgVantage  bonds)  or LTSPCs is
summarized in the table below.

     For  several  years,  Farmer  Mac  has  conducted  guarantee  fee  adequacy
analyses,  using stress-test models developed internally and with the assistance
of outside  experts.  These  analyses  have taken into  account  the diverse and
dissimilar  characteristics of the various asset categories for which Farmer Mac
manages its risk exposures,  and have evolved as the mix and character of assets
under management has shifted with growth in the business and the addition of new
asset  categories.  Based on current  information,  Farmer Mac believes that its
guarantee fee is adequate compensation for the credit risk that it assumes.

     Farmer  Mac  has  established  underwriting  and  appraisal  standards  for
agricultural  mortgage loans to mitigate the risk of loss from borrower defaults
and to provide guidance concerning the management, administration and conduct of
underwriting and appraisals to all  participating  sellers and potential sellers
in its programs.  These  standards were developed on the basis of industry norms
for agricultural  mortgage loans and are designed to assess the creditworthiness
of the borrower,  as well as the value of the mortgaged property relative to the
amount of the mortgage loan. Farmer Mac requires sellers to make representations
and  warranties  regarding the  conformity of eligible  mortgage  loans to these
standards and other requirements it may impose from time to time.

     Farmer Mac I credit  underwriting  standards require that the loan-to-value
("LTV") ratio for any loan not exceed 70 percent,  except that a loan secured by
a livestock  facility and supported by a contract with an integrator may have an
LTV ratio of up to 75  percent,  a  part-time  farm loan  supported  by  private
mortgage insurance may have an LTV ratio of up to 85 percent and a rural housing
loan supported by private  mortgage  insurance may have an LTV ratio of up to 97
percent.  In the case of newly  originated  loans that are not part-time farm or
rural housing loans,  borrowers on the loans must,  among other criteria set out
in Farmer Mac's  underwriting  standards,  also meet the following  standard pro
forma (that is, giving effect to the new loan) credit ratios:

     o    debt-to-asset ratio of 50 percent or less;
     o    cash flow debt service coverage ratio on the mortgaged property of not
          less than 1:1;
     o    total debt service coverage ratio, including farm and non-farm income,
          of not less than 1.25:1; and
     o    ratio of current assets to current liabilities of not less than 1:1.

     Farmer Mac's underwriting standards provide for acceptance of loans that do
not conform to one or more of the standard  underwriting  ratios, other than LTV
ratio, when:

     o    those  loans  exceed one or more of the  underwriting  standards  to a
          degree  that  compensates  for  noncompliance  with one or more  other
          standards, referred to as compensating strengths; and
     o    those  loans  are  made  to  producers  of   particular   agricultural
          commodities  in a segment of  agriculture  in which such  compensating
          strengths are typical of the financial condition of sound borrowers in
          that segment.

Farmer  Mac's use of  compensating  strengths is not intended to provide a basis
for waiving or lessening the requirement that eligible  mortgage loans under the
Farmer Mac I program be of consistently high quality. In fact, loans approved on
the basis of compensating strengths have historically  demonstrated a lower rate
of  default  than that of loans that  conformed  to all of the  standard  credit
ratios.  As of March 31,  2003, a total of $1.5  billion  (30.5  percent) of the
outstanding  balance of loans held and loans underlying LTSPCs and Post-1996 Act
Farmer  Mac I  Guaranteed  Securities  were  approved  based  upon  compensating
strengths  ($32.6  million of which had  original  LTV ratios of greater than 70
percent).  During first quarter 2003,  $57.4 million (25.4 percent) of the loans
purchased or added under LTSPCs were approved based upon compensating  strengths
($0.3 million of which had original LTV ratios of greater than 70 percent).

     In the case of a seasoned loan, Farmer Mac considers sustained  performance
to be a reliable  alternative  indicator of a borrower's ability to pay the loan
according to its terms.  A seasoned  loan  generally  will be deemed an eligible
loan if:

     o    it  has  been   outstanding   for  at  least  five  years  and  has  a
          loan-to-value ratio of 60 percent or less;

     o    there  have been no  payments  more than 30 days past due  during  the
          previous three years; and

     o    there have been no material restructurings or modifications for credit
          reasons during the previous five years.

     A seasoned loan that has been  outstanding  for more than one year but less
than five years must  substantially  comply with the underwriting  standards for
newly originated loans as of the date the loan was originated by the lender. The
loan must also have a payment  history  that shows no payment  more than 30 days
past due during the three-year period  immediately prior to the date the loan is
either  purchased  by  Farmer  Mac or made  subject  to an  LTSPC.  As with  the
secondary  market for residential  mortgages,  there is no requirement that each
loan's compliance with the underwriting  standards be re-evaluated  after Farmer
Mac accepts the loan into its program.

     The due  diligence  Farmer Mac  performs  before  purchasing,  guaranteeing
securities  backed  by  or  committing  to  purchase  seasoned  loans  includes:
evaluation of loan database  information to determine conformity to the criteria
set forth in the preceding paragraphs;  confirmation that loan file data conform
to database information; validation of supporting credit information in the loan
files;  and  review of loan  collateral  appraisals.  All of the  foregoing  are
performed  through methods that give due regard to the size,  age,  leverage and
nature of the collateral for the loans.

     In the case of rural  housing and  part-time  farm loans,  the borrower may
finance up to 97 percent and 85 percent, respectively, of the appraised value of
the  property  if the amount  above 80  percent  is covered by private  mortgage
insurance. For newly originated part-time farm loans, the borrower must generate
sufficient income from all sources to repay all creditors. A borrower's capacity
to repay debt obligations is determined by two tests:

     o    the borrower's monthly mortgage  payment-to-income  ratio should be 28
          percent or less; and
     o    the  borrower's  monthly  debt  payment-to-income  ratio  should be 36
          percent or less.

     Farmer Mac's appraisal standards for newly originated loans require,  among
other things,  that the  appraisal  function be performed  independently  of the
credit  decision-making   process  and  conform  to  the  Uniform  Standards  of
Professional  Appraisal Practice  promulgated by the Appraisal  Standards Board.
Farmer Mac's appraisal  standards require the appraisal function to be conducted
or administered by an individual  meeting specific  qualification and competence
criteria and who:

     o    is not  associated,  except by the engagement for the appraisal,  with
          the credit  underwriters  making the loan  decision,  though  both the
          appraiser  and the credit  underwriter  may be directly or  indirectly
          employed by a common employer;
     o    receives no financial or professional benefit of any kind by virtue of
          the report content,  valuation or credit decision made or based on the
          appraisal product; and
     o    has no present or contemplated  future direct or indirect  interest in
          the appraised property.

The appraisal  standards also require uniform reporting of reliable and credible
opinions   of  the  market   value,   market  rent  and   property   net  income
characteristics of the mortgaged property and the relative market forces.

     Farmer Mac requires current  collateral  valuations in conformance with the
Uniform Standards of Professional  Appraisal Practice for newly originated loans
purchased  or placed  under a Farmer Mac I  Guaranteed  Security  or LTSPC.  For
seasoned loans, Farmer Mac obtains appraisal updates as considered  necessary by
its assessment of collateral risk determined in the due diligence process.

     Farmer Mac  maintains an allowance for losses to cover  estimated  probable
losses on loans  held,  real estate  owned and loans  underlying  Post-1996  Act
Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities  and LTSPCs in accordance  with Statement of
Financial  Accounting  Standard No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies,  ("SFAS 5")
and Statement of Financial  Accounting Standard No. 114, Accounting by Creditors
for  Impairment of a Loan ("SFAS 114").  The  methodology  for  determining  the
allowance  for  losses  is the same for  loans  held for  investment  and  loans
underlying  Post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities and LTSPCs because
Farmer Mac believes the ultimate  credit risk is the same,  i.e., the underlying
agricultural  mortgage loans all meet the same credit underwriting and appraisal
standards.  For  accepting  the credit risk on loans  underlying  Post-1996  Act
Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities  and LTSPCs,  Farmer Mac receives  guarantee
fees and  commitment  fees,  respectively.  For loans held,  Farmer Mac receives
interest  income that includes a component that correlates to its guarantee fee,
which Farmer Mac views as compensation for accepting credit risk.

     No  allowance  for losses has been made for loans  underlying  Farmer Mac I
Guaranteed  Securities  issued prior to the 1996 Act or Farmer Mac II Guaranteed
Securities.  Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities issued prior to the 1996 Act are
supported by unguaranteed first-loss subordinated interests,  which are expected
to exceed the estimated credit losses on those loans.  USDA-guaranteed  portions
collateralizing  Farmer Mac II Guaranteed  Securities are obligations  backed by
the full  faith  and  credit  of the  United  States.  To date,  Farmer  Mac has
experienced  no credit  losses  on any  pre-1996  Act  Farmer  Mac I  Guaranteed
Securities or on any Farmer Mac II Guaranteed  Securities and does not expect to
incur any such losses in the future.

     The  allowance  for  losses  is  presented  in  three   components  on  the
consolidated balance sheet:

     o    an "Allowance for loan losses" on loans held for investment;
     o    a valuation  allowance on real estate owned,  which is included in the
          balance sheet under "Real estate owned (net of valuation  allowance)";
          and
     o    an allowance for losses on loans underlying Post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I
          Guaranteed  Securities  and  LTSPCs,  which is included in the balance
          sheet under "Reserve for losses."

     The provision for losses is presented in two components on the consolidated
statement of operations:

     o    a "Provision for loan losses," which represents losses on Farmer Mac's
          loans held for investment; and
     o    a "Provision for losses," which represents  losses on loans underlying
          Post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities  and LTSPCs and real
          estate owned.

     Farmer Mac's allowance for losses is estimated  using a systematic  process
that begins with management's  evaluation of the results of its proprietary loan
pool  simulation  and  guarantee fee model (the  "Model");  those results may be
modified by the  application  of  management's  judgment that takes into account
factors including:

     o    economic conditions;
     o    geographic and agricultural  commodity  concentrations of Farmer Mac's
          portfolio;
     o    the credit profile of Farmer Mac's portfolio;
     o    delinquency trends of Farmer Mac's portfolio; and
     o    historical   charge-offs  and  recovery  activities  of  Farmer  Mac's
          portfolio.

     The Model offers historical loss experience on agricultural  mortgage loans
similar to those on which Farmer Mac has assumed  credit risk, but over a longer
period of time than Farmer Mac's own experience to date. Farmer Mac's systematic
methodology for determining its allowance for losses is expected to migrate over
time,  away from the Model and  toward  the  increased  use of Farmer  Mac's own
historical  portfolio loss experience,  as that experience continues to develop.
During this  migration,  Farmer Mac will  continue  to use the results  from the
Model,  augmented by the  application of management's  judgment,  to develop its
loan loss allowance.

     Management  believes that its use of this  methodology  produces a reliable
estimate of total probable  losses,  as of the balance sheet date, for all loans
included in Farmer Mac's  portfolio,  including loans held and loans  underlying
Post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs.

     In  addition,   Farmer  Mac   specifically   analyzes   its   portfolio  of
non-performing  assets  (loans  90  days  or  more  past  due,  in  foreclosure,
restructured,  in  bankruptcy - including  loans  performing  under either their
original loan terms or a court-approved  bankruptcy plan, and real estate owned)
on a loan-by-loan  basis.  This analysis  measures  impairment based on the fair
value of the  underlying  collateral  for each  individual  loan relative to the
total amount due, including principal,  interest and advances under SFAS 114. In
the event that the updated  appraisal  or  management's  estimate of  discounted
collateral  value does not support the total amount due, Farmer Mac specifically
determines  an allowance  for the loan for the  difference  between the recorded
investment and its fair value, less estimated costs to liquidate the collateral.

     Management  believes that the general  allowance,  which is the  difference
between the total allowance for losses (generated  through use of the Model) and
the specific  allowances,  adequately covers any probable losses inherent in the
portfolio of performing loans under SFAS 5.

     Farmer  Mac  considers  that the  methodology  described  above  produces a
reliable  estimate  of the total  probable  losses  inherent  in the  Farmer Mac
portfolio. The Model:

     o    runs various  configurations of loan types, terms, economic conditions
          and borrower  eligibility  criteria to generate a distribution of loss
          exposures over time for all loans in the portfolio;
     o    uses  historical   agricultural   real  estate  loan  origination  and
          servicing  data that reflect  varied  economic  conditions  and stress
          levels in the agricultural sector;
     o    contains  features that allow variations for changes in loan portfolio
          characteristics  to make the data set more  representative  of  Farmer
          Mac's portfolio and credit underwriting standards; and
     o    considers  the effects of the ageing of the loan  portfolio  along the
          expected loss curves  associated  with individual  cohort  origination
          years,  including the segments that are entering into or coming out of
          their peak default years.

     Farmer Mac analyzes  various  iterations  of the Model data to evaluate its
overall  allowance  for loss and back tests the results to  validate  the Model.
Such tests use prior period data to project losses  expected in a current period
and compare  those  projections  to actual  losses  incurred  during the current
period.

     The  allowance  for losses is increased  through  periodic  provisions  for
losses charged to expense and reduced by charge-offs  for actual losses,  net of
recoveries   that  are  recognized  if  liquidation   proceeds  exceed  previous
estimates.  Charge-offs  represent losses on the outstanding  principal balance,
any interest  payments  previously  accrued or advanced  and  expected  costs of
liquidation.

allowance for losses for the three months ended March 31, 2003 and 2002:

When certain  criteria are met, such as the default of the borrower,  Farmer Mac
has the option to purchase the defaulted loans underlying  Farmer Mac Guaranteed
Securities  and is  obligated  to  purchase  those  underlying  an LTSPC.  These
acquisitions are recorded in the consolidated financial statements at their fair
value.  Fair value is  determined  by  appraisal  or  management's  estimate  of
discounted  collateral  value. In September 2002,  Farmer Mac adopted EITF issue
02-9,  Accounting for Changes That Result in a Transferor  Regaining  Control of
Financial Assets Sold ("the consensus" or "EITF 02-9").  The consensus  requires
that Farmer Mac record,  at  acquisition,  the  difference  between  each loan's
acquisition  cost and its fair  value,  if any,  as a charge to the  reserve for
losses. Prior to the adoption of the consensus,  any specific allowance that had
been   established  for  the  off-balance   sheet  obligation  would  have  been
transferred  from the  reserve  for  losses  to the  allowance  for loan  losses
(referred to as "net allocation of the allowance" in the table above).  Upon the
receipt of each  loan's  updated  appraisal  or  determination  of  management's
estimate of discounted  collateral value, the difference between the acquisition
cost of the loan and its fair  value,  if any,  was  recorded as a charge to the
allowance for loan losses.

     Farmer Mac's total  provision for losses was $2.1 million for first quarter
2003,  compared to $2.0 million for first  quarter  2002.  During first  quarter
2003,  Farmer Mac charged off $1.2 million in losses  against the  allowance for
losses and recovered $0.2 million from  previously  charged off losses,  for net
charge-offs of $1.0 million.  During first quarter 2002,  Farmer Mac charged off
$0.9  million  in losses  against  the  allowance  for losses  and  recorded  no
recoveries  from  previously  charged off losses,  for net  charge-offs  of $0.9
million.  As of March 31, 2003,  Farmer Mac's allowance for losses totaled $21.1
million,  or 44 basis points of the outstanding  principal balance of loans held
and loans  underlying  Post-1996  Act Farmer  Mac I  Guaranteed  Securities  and
LTSPCs, compared to $20.0 million (42 basis points) as of December 31, 2002.

     As of March 31, 2003, loans held and loans underlying  Post-1996 Act Farmer
Mac I  Guaranteed  Securities  and LTSPCs that were 90 days or more past due, in
foreclosure,  restructured  after  delinquency,  in bankruptcy  (including loans
performing under either their original loan terms or a court-approved bankruptcy
plan) and real estate owned  ("Post-1996  Act  non-performing  assets")  totaled
$94.8 million and represented 1.97 percent of the principal balance of all loans
held and loans underlying  Post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities and
LTSPCs,  compared to $87.1  million (2.32  percent) as of March 31, 2002.  Loans
that  have  been  restructured  after  delinquency  were  insignificant  and are
included  within  the  reported  90-day  delinquency  and  non-performing  asset
disclosures.  As of March 31, 2003,  Farmer Mac's 90-day  delinquencies  totaled
$76.2 million and represented 1.58 percent of the principal balance of all loans
held and loans underlying  Post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities and
LTSPCs,  compared to $79.2  million  (2.11  percent) as of March 31, 2002.  From
quarter  to  quarter,  Farmer Mac  anticipates  the  90-day  delinquencies  will
fluctuate,  both in dollars and as a percentage  of the  outstanding  portfolio,
with  higher  levels  likely at the end of the first and third  quarters of each
year  corresponding  to the  semi-annual  (January  1st and  July  1st)  payment
characteristics of most Farmer Mac I loans.

</TABLE>


     As of March 31, 2003,  approximately  $1.8 billion (37.4 percent) of Farmer
Mac's  outstanding  loans held and loans  underlying  Post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I
Guaranteed  Securities  and LTSPCs  were in their peak  delinquency  and default
years  compared  to $1.4  billion  (37.0  percent) of such loans as of March 31,
2002.  The Model  takes the  portfolio  age  distribution  and  maturation  into
consideration.  Accordingly,  those trends did not cause management to alter the
Model's projection for the provisions for losses.

     As of March 31,  2003,  Farmer  Mac's  loan-by-loan  analysis  of its $94.8
million of  non-performing  assets and their updated  appraisals or management's
estimates of discounted  values  indicated that $81.6 million of  non-performing
assets  were  adequately   collateralized,   based  on  updated   appraisals  or
management's  estimates of discounted collateral values, and that the allocation
of  specific  allowances  to  those  loans  was  not  necessary.   Farmer  Mac's
loan-by-loan   analyses   indicated   that  the  remaining   $13.2  million  had
insufficient  collateral  to  cover  the  loan  balance,  accrued  interest  and
expenses.  Farmer Mac has  specifically  allocated $2.6 million of allowances to
those under-collateralized  loans. As of March 31, 2003, after the allocation of
specific  allowances to  under-collateralized  loans,  Farmer Mac had additional
non-specific  or  general  allowances  of $18.5  million  relating  to  inherent
probable loss in the portfolio, bringing the total allowance for losses to $21.1
million. The following table summarizes the Farmer Mac's  non-performing  assets
and allowance for losses:

</TABLE>



Based on Farmer Mac's  loan-by-loan  analyses,  loan  collection  experience and
continuing  provisions  for the allowance  for losses,  Farmer Mac believes that
specific and inherent  probable  losses are covered  adequately by the allowance
for losses.

     Original  loan-to-value ratios are one of many factors Farmer Mac considers
in evaluating  loss  severity.  Other factors  include,  but are not limited to,
other  underwriting  standards,  commodity  and farming  forecasts  and regional
economic and agricultural conditions.  Loans in the Farmer Mac I program are all
first  mortgage  agricultural  real  estate  loans.  Accordingly,  Farmer  Mac's
exposure on a loan is limited to the difference between the principal balance of
a loan and the value of the property. Measurement of that excess or shortfall is
the best  predictor  and  determinant  of loss  compared to other  measures that
evaluate the efficiency of a particular farm operator.

     Loan-to-value  ratios depend upon the economic value of a property with due
regard for its income-producing  potential in the hands of a competent operator.
As required by Farmer  Mac's  collateral  valuation  standards,  an appraisal of
agricultural   real  estate  must  include  analysis  of  the  income  producing
capability  of the  property  and  address  the  income  estimate  in the market
analysis. Debt service ratios depend upon farm operator efficiency and leverage,
which  can  vary  widely  within  a  geographic  region,  commodity  type  or an
operator's business and farming skills.

     As of March 31, 2003, the weighted-average original loan-to-value ratio for
all loans  held and loans  underlying  Post-1996  Act  Farmer  Mac I  Guaranteed
Securities  and  LTSPCs  was  49  percent,  and  the  weighted-average  original
loan-to-value ratio for all Post-1996 Act non-performing assets was 55 percent.

     The following table summarizes the Post-1996 Act  non-performing  assets by
original  loan-to-value ratio (calculated by dividing the loan principal balance
at the time of guarantee,  purchase or commitment by the appraised  value at the
date of loan origination or, when available, updated appraised value at the time
of guarantee, purchase or commitment):

     An analysis  of Farmer  Mac's  historical  losses and  identified  specific
collateral  deficiencies  within the portfolio (by  origination  year) indicates
that  Farmer Mac has  experienced  peak loss  years as loans  have aged  between
approximately their third and fifth years subsequent to origination,  regardless
of the year the loans were added to the Farmer Mac's portfolio. As a consequence
of the combination of principal  amortization and collateral value appreciation,
there  are few  loans  in the  portfolio  originated  prior to 1996  with  known
collateral deficiencies.  While Farmer Mac expects that there will be loans that
have aged  past  their  fifth  year that will  become  delinquent  and  possibly
default, Farmer Mac does not anticipate significant losses on such loans.

     Analysis of the portfolio by its  geographic  distribution  indicates  that
losses and  collateral  deficiencies  have been and are  expected to remain most
prevalent in the loans concentrated in the areas that do not receive significant
government  support.  This analysis is consistent with  corresponding  commodity
analysis,  which  indicates  that  Farmer Mac has  experienced  higher  loss and
collateral deficiency rates in its loans classified as permanent plantings. Most
of the loans  classified  as  permanent  plantings  do not  receive  significant
government   support   and   are   therefore   more   susceptible   to   adverse
commodity-specific  economic trends.  Further,  as adverse  economic  conditions
persist for a particular commodity that requires a long-term  improvement on the
land, such as permanent  plantings,  the  prospective  sale value of the land is
likely to decrease and the related loans may become under-collateralized. Farmer
Mac  anticipates  that one or more  particular  commodity  groups  will be under
economic pressure at any one time and actively manages its portfolio to mitigate
concentration  risks while preserving Farmer Mac's ability to meet the financing
needs of all commodity groups.

     Farmer Mac's  methodologies  for pricing its guarantee and commitment fees,
managing credit risks and providing adequate  allowances for losses consider all
of the foregoing factors and information.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

     Farmer Mac has  sufficient  liquidity and capital  resources to support its
operations for the next twelve months.

     Debt Issuance.  Section 8.6(e) of Farmer Mac's statutory charter (12 U.S.C.
ss.  2279aa-6(e))  authorizes  Farmer Mac to issue debt  obligations to purchase
eligible  mortgage  loans and Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities and to maintain
reasonable amounts for business operations, including adequate liquidity. Farmer
Mac funds its  program  operations  primarily  by issuing  debt  obligations  of
various maturities in the public capital markets.  Farmer Mac's debt obligations
consist  of  discount  notes  and  medium-term  notes  issued  to  obtain  funds
principally  to cover the costs of purchasing  and holding loans and  securities
(including  Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities).  Farmer Mac also issues discount
notes and medium-term  notes to obtain funds for investments,  transaction costs
and guarantee payments.  The Corporation's  discount notes and medium-term notes
are  obligations  of Farmer Mac only, are not rated by any rating agency and the
interest and principal thereon are not guaranteed by and do not constitute debts
or obligations of FCA or the United States or any agency or  instrumentality  of
the United  States other than Farmer Mac.  Farmer Mac is an  institution  of the
Farm Credit  System,  but is not liable for any debt or  obligation of any other
institution of the Farm Credit System. Likewise,  neither the Farm Credit System
nor any other individual institution of the Farm Credit System is liable for any
debt or  obligation  of Farmer Mac.  Income on Farmer Mac's  discount  notes and
medium-term notes has no tax exemption under federal law from federal,  state or
local taxation.

     Farmer Mac's board of directors has  authorized  the issuance of up to $5.0
billion of  discount  notes and  medium-term  notes (of which $3.8  billion  was
outstanding as of March 31, 2003), subject to periodic review of the adequacy of
that level relative to Farmer Mac's borrowing  requirements.  Farmer Mac invests
the proceeds of such issuances in loans,  Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities and
non-program  investment assets in accordance with guidelines  established by its
board of directors.

     Liquidity.  The  funding  and  liquidity  needs of  Farmer  Mac's  business
programs are driven by the purchase and  retention of eligible  loans and Farmer
Mac  Guaranteed  Securities,  the  maturities of Farmer Mac's discount notes and
medium-term notes and payment of principal and interest on Farmer Mac Guaranteed
Securities. Farmer Mac's primary sources of funds to meet these needs are:

     o    principal and interest  payments and ongoing  guarantee and commitment
          fees received on loans,  Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities and LTSPCs;
          and
     o    the issuance of discount notes and medium-term notes.

     Farmer Mac  projects  its  expected  cash flows from loans and  securities,
other earnings and the sale of assets and matches those with its  obligations to
retire  debt and pay  other  liabilities  as they come due.  Farmer  Mac  issues
discount  notes  and  medium-term  notes to meet the needs  associated  with its
business operations,  including liquidity,  and also to increase its presence in
the capital markets in order to enhance the liquidity and pricing  efficiency of
its discount notes and  medium-term  notes and Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities
transactions  and so improve the mortgage rates  available to farmers,  ranchers
and rural  homeowners.  Though Farmer Mac's mortgage  purchases do not currently
necessitate daily debt issuance, the Corporation continued its strategy of using
its  non-program  investment  portfolio  (referred to as Farmer Mac's  liquidity
portfolio) to facilitate  increasing its ongoing presence in the capital markets
during first quarter 2003.  To meet  investor  demand for daily  presence in the
capital markets, Farmer Mac issues discount notes in maturities ranging from one
day to  approximately  90 days and invests the  proceeds  not needed for program
asset  purchases  in  highly-rated  securities.  Investments  are  predominantly
short-term  money  market  securities  with  maturities  closely  matched to the
discount note maturities and  floating-rate  securities with reset terms of less
than one year and closely  matched to the  maturity of the discount  notes.  The
positive spread earned from these  investments  enhances the net interest income
Farmer  Mac earns,  thereby  improving  the net  yields at which  Farmer Mac can
purchase  mortgages from lenders who may pass that benefit to farmers,  ranchers
and  rural  homeowners  through  the  Farmer  Mac  programs.  Subject  to dollar
limitations,  the  Corporation's  board of directors has authorized  non-program
investments in:

     o    U.S. treasury obligations;
     o    agency and instrumentality obligations;
     o    repurchase agreements;
     o    commercial paper;
     o    guaranteed investment contracts;
     o    certificates of deposit;
     o    federal funds and bankers acceptances;
     o    certain  securities  and debt  obligations  of corporate and municipal
          issuers;
     o    asset-backed securities;
     o    corporate money market funds; and
     o    preferred stock of government-sponsored enterprises.

As of March 31, 2003,  Farmer Mac was in compliance with the dollar  limitations
and investment authorizations set forth in its investment guidelines.

     As a result  of  Farmer  Mac's  regular  issuance  of  discount  notes  and
medium-term notes and its status as a federally chartered instrumentality of the
United  States,  Farmer  Mac has been  able to access  the  capital  markets  at
favorable  rates.  During  first  quarter  2003 and  throughout  the  period  of
inaccurate and misleading  publicity about the Corporation  during 2002,  Farmer
Mac  maintained  regular  daily  access  to the  discount  note  market at rates
comparable  to the  issuance  and trading  levels of other  government-sponsored
enterprise discount notes. Farmer Mac's continued ability to access the discount
note market at such  favorable  rates could be affected by continued  inaccurate
and misleading  publicity about Farmer Mac or unusual trading in its securities.
Farmer Mac  believes  such factors  caused  spread  levels in  secondary  market
trading of its  outstanding  medium-term  notes to widen during  second  quarter
2002.  Although  those trading  spreads have improved and Farmer Mac returned to
issuing  medium-term notes at favorable issuance spreads,  the foregoing factors
could affect future medium-term note issuance spreads adversely and cause Farmer
Mac to emphasize  floating-to-fixed  interest rate swaps, combined with discount
note  issuances,  as a source  of  fixed-rate  funding.  While  the swap  market
provides favorable fixed rates, swap transactions  expose Farmer Mac to the risk
of future widening of its own issuance spreads versus corresponding LIBOR rates.
If the spreads on the Farmer Mac  discount  notes were to  increase  relative to
LIBOR,  Farmer  Mac would be  exposed  to a  commensurate  reduction  on its net
interest  yield on the notional  amount of its  floating-to-fixed  interest rate
swaps and other  LIBOR-based  floating rate assets.  Farmer Mac  compensates for
this risk by pricing  the  required  net yield on  program  asset  purchases  to
reflect  the higher  cost of  medium-term  notes  issuance  versus  the  savings
achieved in the interest rate swap market.

     Farmer Mac maintains an investment  portfolio of cash and cash  equivalents
(including  commercial paper and other short-term money market  instruments) and
investment securities consisting mostly of floating rate securities that reprice
within one year,  which can be drawn upon for liquidity  needs.  As of March 31,
2003, Farmer Mac's cash and cash equivalents and investment  securities  totaled
$685.8  million and $887.3  million,  respectively,  a combined  37.5 percent of
total assets. For first quarter 2003, exclusive of daily overnight discount note
issuances that were invested overnight,  the average discount note issuance term
and re-funding frequency was approximately 77 days.

Other Matters

     On June 26, 2002,  the Senate  Committee  on  Agriculture,  Nutrition,  and
Forestry  requested that the U.S. General  Accounting  Office ("GAO") conduct an
independent analysis of a number of issues relating to Farmer Mac. The Committee
made this  request of the GAO in response to reports  Farmer Mac  believes to be
misleading  and  speculation  about Farmer Mac  produced by certain  hedge funds
acting  as  "short  sellers,"  who  stood  to gain if the  price of  Farmer  Mac
securities was depressed,  and in concurrent  articles by a reporter for a major
newspaper.  Farmer  Mac made it clear  that  those  reports  and  articles  were
inaccurate and misleading and welcomed the independent analysis by the GAO as an
opportunity   to  confirm   that   Farmer   Mac   continues   to   fulfill   its
Congressionally-established mission in a financially safe and sound manner.

     The GAO report  was  requested  by the  Committee  specifically  to address
Farmer Mac's financial stability;  corporate governance;  compensation policies;
investment  practices;  the  non-voting  status of Farmer  Mac's  Class C common
stock; and the fulfillment of Farmer Mac's Congressionally-established mission.

     Farmer Mac looks forward to the GAO report as an  opportunity to remove the
confusion  that has been cast over it, so that it may  continue  to fulfill  its
Congressional mission for agricultural borrowers and the lenders who serve them.

of,  provisions  of Title VIII of the Farm Credit Act of 1971,  as amended  (the

effect on November 23, 1993 and are  qualified  by reference  thereto and to any
subsequent amendments thereto.

     The Act  provides  that the  board of  directors  of the  Corporation  (the

     The ratio of  dividends  paid on each  share of Class C  Non-Voting  Common

                    FEDERAL AGRICULTURAL MORTGAGE CORPORATION

               CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATION OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                                       of
                   6.40% CUMULATIVE PREFERRED STOCK, SERIES A
      (par value $1.00 per share; liquidation preference $50.00 per share)

     I,  Jerome  G.  Oslick,  Secretary  of the  Federal  Agricultural  Mortgage
Corporation,  a  federally  chartered  instrumentality  of the United  States of
America ("Farmer Mac" or the "Corporation"), do hereby certify that, pursuant to
authority  vested in the Board of Directors  of Farmer Mac by Section  8.4(e) of
the Farm Credit Act of 1971,  as amended  (12 U.S.C.  ss.ss.  2279aa-4(e)),  the
Board of  Directors  adopted  resolutions  on June 7, 2001 and February 7, 2002,
which  resolutions are now, and at all times since such dates have been, in full
force  and  effect,  and that  the  Chief  Executive  Officer,  pursuant  to the
authority delegated to him by such resolutions,  approved the final terms of the
public issuance and sale of the preferred stock of Farmer Mac designated above.

     The 6.40%  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock,  Series A shall have the following
designation,   powers,   preferences,   rights,   privileges,    qualifications,
limitations, restrictions, terms and conditions:

1.  Designation, Par Value, Number of Shares and Seniority

     The  class  of  preferred  stock of the  Corporation  created  hereby  (the
"Preferred Stock") shall be designated "6.40% Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series
A," shall have a par value of $1.00 per share and a  liquidation  preference  of
$50.00 per share and shall consist of 700,000 shares. The Board of Directors, or
a duly  authorized  committee  thereof,  shall  be  permitted  to  increase  the
authorized  number of such shares at any time.  The  Preferred  Stock shall rank
senior to the Class A Voting Common Stock, Class B Voting Common Stock and Class
C Non-Voting Common Stock of the Corporation (collectively,  the "Common Stock")
to the extent provided in this Certificate.

2.  Dividends

     (a) Holders of outstanding  shares of the Preferred Stock shall be entitled
to receive,  ratably,  when as and if declared by the Board of  Directors in its
sole  discretion,   out  of  funds  legally  available  for  dividend  payments,
cumulative  quarterly  cash  dividends  at  the  annual  rate  of  6.40%  of its
liquidation preference, or $3.20, per share of Preferred Stock. Dividends on the
Preferred  Stock shall  accrue from but not  including  May 6, 2002 and shall be
payable when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors on March 31, June 30,
September 30 and  December 31 of each year (each,  a "Dividend  Payment  Date"),
beginning on June 30, 2002. If a Dividend  Payment Date is not a "Business Day,"
the related  dividend shall be paid on the next Business Day with the same force
and effect as though paid on the Dividend Payment Date,  without any increase to
account  for the period  from such  Dividend  Payment  Date  through the date of
actual payment. For these purposes,  "Business Day" means a day other than (i) a
Saturday or Sunday,  (ii) a day on which New York City banks are closed or (iii)
a day on which the  offices  of Farmer Mac are  closed.  The  "Dividend  Period"
relating to a Dividend  Payment Date shall be the period from but not  including
the  preceding  Dividend  Payment Date (or from but not including May 6, 2002 in
the case of the first  Dividend  Payment Date) through and including the related
Dividend Payment Date. If declared, the dividend payable in respect of the first
Dividend  Period shall be $0.48 per share.  The amount of  dividends  payable in
respect of any quarterly  Dividend  Period other than the first Dividend  Period
shall be  computed  at a rate  equal to $3.20  divided  by four.  The  amount of
dividends  payable for any period shorter than a full quarterly  Dividend Period
shall be  computed  on the basis of twelve  30-day  months  and a 360-day  year.
Dividends  shall be paid to  holders  of  record  of  outstanding  shares of the
Preferred  Stock as they  appear in the books and  records  of Farmer Mac on the
record date fixed by the Board of Directors,  not to be earlier than 45 days nor
later than 10 days preceding the applicable Dividend Payment Date.

     If Farmer Mac redeems the Preferred Stock, any accrued and unpaid dividends
through and including the date of redemption shall be included in the redemption
price of the shares redeemed and shall not be separately payable.

     (b) No dividends  shall be declared or paid or set apart for payment on the
Common Stock or any other class or series of stock ranking  junior to or (except
as  hereinafter  provided) on a parity with the Preferred  Stock with respect to
the payment of dividends  unless  dividends  have been  declared and paid or set
apart (or ordered by our Board of  Directors to be set apart) for payment on the
outstanding  Preferred  Stock  in  respect  of the  then-current  and any  prior
Dividend Periods;  provided,  however,  that the foregoing  dividend  preference
shall not in any way  create  any claim or right in favor of the  holders of the
Preferred  Stock in the event that Farmer Mac shall not have declared or paid or
set apart (or the Board of  Directors  shall not have  ordered  to be set apart)
dividends on the Preferred Stock in respect of any prior Dividend Period. In the
event  that  Farmer  Mac  shall  not pay any one or more  dividends  or any part
thereof on the Preferred  Stock,  the holders of the  Preferred  Stock shall not
have any claim in respect of such non-payment so long as no dividend (other than
those  referred  to above) is paid on the  Common  Stock or any junior or parity
stock in violation of the next preceding sentence.

     (c) If, prior to November 6, 2003,  an  amendment  to the Internal  Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), is enacted that reduces or eliminates the
percentage of the dividends-received deduction applicable to the Preferred Stock
as specified in Section  243(a)(1) of the Code or any successor  provision  (the
"Dividends-Received  Percentage"),  including  any  change  applicable  only  to
certain  categories of stock, which change is applicable to the Preferred Stock,
certain  adjustments  may be made in  respect  of the  dividends  payable by the
Corporation,  and Post Declaration Date Dividends and Retroactive  Dividends (as
such terms are defined below) may become payable, as described below.

     The amount of each  dividend  payable (if  declared) per share of Preferred
Stock for dividend  payments made on or after the effective  date of such change
in the Code shall be adjusted by multiplying the amount of the dividend  payable
pursuant to Section 2(a)  (before  adjustment)  by a factor,  which shall be the
number  determined in accordance with the following formula (the "DRD Formula"),
and rounding the result to the nearest cent (with one-half cent rounded up):

                               1 - 0.35(1 - 0.70)
                              --------------------
                               1 - 0.35(1 - DRP)

For  the  purposes  of the  DRD  Formula,  "DRP"  means  the  Dividends-Received
Percentage  (expressed  as a decimal)  applicable  to the  dividend in question;
provided,  however, that if the Dividends-Received  Percentage applicable to the
dividend  in  question  is less than  50%,  then the DRP shall  equal  0.50.  No
amendment  to  the  Code,   other  than  a  change  in  the  percentage  of  the
dividends-received  deduction set forth in Section  243(a)(1) of the Code or any
successor  provision,  or a change in the  percentage of the  dividends-received
deduction  for certain  categories  of stock,  which change is applicable to the
Preferred Stock, shall give rise to an adjustment.

     Notwithstanding  the  foregoing  provisions,  if, with  respect to any such
amendment,  the Corporation receives either an unqualified opinion of nationally
recognized  independent  tax counsel  selected by the  Corporation  or a private
letter  ruling or similar form of assurance  from the Internal  Revenue  Service
(the  "IRS") to the effect that such an  amendment  does not apply to a dividend
payable on the  Preferred  Stock,  then such  amendment  shall not result in the
adjustment  provided  for  pursuant  to the DRD  Formula  with  respect  to such
dividend.  The opinion  referenced in the previous  sentence shall be based upon
the  legislation   amending  or  establishing   the  DRP  or  upon  a  published
pronouncement  of the  IRS  addressing  such  legislation.  Unless  the  context
otherwise  requires,  references  to dividends  herein  shall mean  dividends as
adjusted by the DRD Formula.

     Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such amendment to the Code is enacted
after the  dividend  payable on a Dividend  Payment  Date has been  declared but
before  such  dividend  is paid,  the  amount of the  dividend  payable  on such
Dividend Payment Date shall not be increased. Instead, additional dividends (the
"Post  Declaration  Date  Dividends"),  equal to the excess,  if any, of (x) the
product of the dividend paid by the  Corporation  on such Dividend  Payment Date
and the DRD Formula (where the DRP used in the DRD Formula would be equal to the
greater of the  Dividends-Received  Percentage  applicable  to the  dividend  in
question and .50) over (y) the dividend paid by the Corporation on such Dividend
Payment Date,  shall be payable (if  declared) to holders of Preferred  Stock on
the record date  applicable  to the next  succeeding  Dividend  Payment Date, in
addition to any other amounts payable on such date.

     If any such  amendment  to the Code is  enacted  and the  reduction  in the
Dividends-Received  Percentage  retroactively applies to a Dividend Payment Date
as to which the  Corporation  previously  paid dividends on the Preferred  Stock
(each,  an "Affected  Dividend  Payment Date"),  the  Corporation  shall pay (if
declared) additional  dividends (the "Retroactive  Dividends") to holders on the
record date applicable to the next succeeding Dividend Payment Date (or, if such
amendment is enacted after the dividend  payable on such  Dividend  Payment Date
has been  declared,  to  holders  on the record  date  applicable  to the second
succeeding  Dividend  Payment Date following the date of enactment) in an amount
equal to the excess of (x) the product of the dividend  paid by the  Corporation
on each Affected  Dividend  Payment Date and the DRD Formula (where the DRP used
in the DRD  Formula  would  be equal to the  greater  of the  Dividends-Received
Percentage and 0.50 applied to each Affected Dividend Payment Date) over (y) the
sum of the dividend paid by the  Corporation on each Affected  Dividend  Payment
Date. The Corporation  shall make only one payment of Retroactive  Dividends for
any such amendment.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions,  if, with respect
to any such amendment, the Corporation receives either an unqualified opinion of
nationally  recognized  independent tax counsel selected by the Corporation or a
private  letter  ruling or similar form of assurance  from the IRS to the effect
that such amendment does not apply to a dividend payable on an Affected Dividend
Payment Date for the Preferred  Stock,  then such amendment  shall not result in
the payment of  Retroactive  Dividends  with respect to such  Affected  Dividend
Payment Date. The opinion referenced in the previous sentence must be based upon
the  legislation   amending  or  establishing   the  DRP  or  upon  a  published
pronouncement of the IRS addressing such legislation.

     In the  event  that  the  amount  of  dividends  payable  per  share of the
Preferred Stock is adjusted  pursuant to the DRD Formula and/or Post Declaration
Date Dividends or Retroactive  Dividends are to be paid, the  Corporation  shall
give notice of each such  adjustment  and, if applicable,  any Post  Declaration
Date Dividends and  Retroactive  Dividends to be given as soon as practicable to
the holders of Preferred Stock.

     (d) Notwithstanding  any other provision of this Certificate,  the Board of
Directors, in its discretion, may choose to pay dividends on the Preferred Stock
without  the  payment  of  any  dividends  on the  Common  Stock  or  any  other
outstanding  class or series of stock ranking junior to the Preferred Stock with
respect to the payment of dividends.

     (e) No  dividend  shall be declared or paid or set apart for payment on any
shares of the Preferred  Stock if at the same time any arrears or default exists
in the  payment  of  dividends  on any  outstanding  class or series of stock of
Farmer Mac ranking senior to or (except as provided herein) on a parity with the
Preferred  Stock with  respect  to the  payment of  dividends.  If and  whenever
dividends, having been declared, shall not have been paid in full, as aforesaid,
on shares of the Preferred  Stock and on the shares of any other class or series
of stock of Farmer Mac ranking on a parity with the Preferred Stock with respect
to the  payment of  dividends,  all such  dividends  that have been  declared on
shares of the  Preferred  Stock and on the  shares  of any such  other  class or
series shall be paid pro rata, so that the respective  amounts of dividends paid
per share on the Preferred  Stock and on such other class or series shall in all
cases bear to each other the same ratio that the respective amounts of dividends
declared but unpaid per share on the shares of the  Preferred  Stock  (including
any adjustments due to changes in the Dividends-Received  Percentage) and on the
shares of such other class or series bear to each other.

     (f) Holders of shares of the  Preferred  Stock shall not be entitled to any
dividends, whether payable in cash or in property, other than as herein provided
and shall not be entitled to interest,  or any sum in lieu of interest, on or in
respect of any dividend payment.

3.  Optional Redemption

     (a) The Preferred  Stock shall not be  redeemable  before June 30, 2012. On
that date and at any time thereafter, subject to the notice provisions set forth
in Section 3(b) below and to any further limitations that may be imposed by law,
Farmer Mac may redeem the  Preferred  Stock,  in whole or in part,  out of funds
legally available therefor,  at the redemption price of $50.00 per share plus an
amount,  determined in accordance  with Section 2 above,  equal to the amount of
any  accrued and unpaid  dividends  for any prior  Dividend  Periods and for the
then-current  Dividend  Period through and including the date of redemption.  If
less  than  all of the  outstanding  shares  of the  Preferred  Stock  are to be
redeemed,  Farmer Mac shall select  shares to be redeemed  from the  outstanding
shares not  previously  called for  redemption  by lot or pro rata (as nearly as
possible) or by any other method which Farmer Mac in its sole  discretion  deems
fair.

     (b) In the event Farmer Mac shall redeem any or all of the Preferred Stock,
Farmer Mac shall give notice of such  redemption  by first  class mail,  postage
prepaid,  mailed  neither  less  than 30 nor  more  than 60  days  prior  to the
redemption  date, to each holder of record of the shares of the Preferred  Stock
being  redeemed,  at such holder's  address as the same appears in the books and
records of Farmer Mac.  Each such notice  shall state the number of shares to be
redeemed,  the redemption price, the redemption date and the place at which such
holder's  certificate(s)  representing  shares of the  Preferred  Stock  must be
presented  for  cancellation  or  exchanges,  as the  case  may  be,  upon  such
redemption.  In the event that fewer than all the shares represented by any such
certificate are redeemed,  a new certificate  shall be issued  representing  the
unredeemed  shares  without  cost to the  holder  thereof.  Failure to duly give
notice,  or any defect in the notice, to any holder of the Preferred Stock shall
not affect the validity of the  proceedings  for the redemption of shares of any
other holder of the Preferred Stock being redeemed.

     (c) If any redemption date is not a Business Day, payment of the redemption
price may be made on the next  Business Day with the same force and effect as if
made on the redemption date, and no interest, additional dividends or other sums
will accrue on the amount payable from the redemption  date to the next Business
Day.

     (d) Notice having been mailed as aforesaid,  from and after the  redemption
date  specified  therein  and upon  payment  of the  consideration  set forth in
Section 3(a) above, said shares of the Preferred Stock shall no longer be deemed
to be  outstanding,  and all  rights of the  holders  thereof  as holders of the
Preferred Stock shall cease, with respect to shares so redeemed.

     (e) Any  shares  of the  Preferred  Stock so  redeemed  shall,  after  such
redemption,  no longer  have the  status of  authorized,  issued or  outstanding
shares.

     (f) The Preferred  Stock shall not be subject to any mandatory  redemption,
sinking fund or other similar provisions. In addition,  holders of the Preferred
Stock shall have no right to require  redemption  of any shares of the Preferred
Stock.

4.  No Voting Rights

     Except as set forth in Section 9 below,  the shares of the Preferred  Stock
shall not have any voting powers, either general or special.

5.  No Conversion or Exchange Rights

     The  holders of shares of the  Preferred  Stock shall not have any right to
convert  such shares into or exchange  such shares for any other class or series
of stock or obligations of Farmer Mac.

6.  No Preemptive Rights

     No holder of the  Preferred  Stock  shall as such  holder be  entitled as a
matter of right to subscribe for or purchase,  or have any preemptive right with
respect to, any new or  additional  issue of other  shares,  rights,  options or
other securities of any class of Farmer Mac whatsoever, whether now or hereafter
authorized  and  whether  issued  for cash or other  consideration  or by way of
dividend.

7.  Liquidation Rights and Preference

     (a) Except as otherwise set forth herein, upon the voluntary or involuntary
dissolution,  liquidation  or  winding  up of Farmer  Mac,  after  payment of or
provision  for  the   liabilities  of  Farmer  Mac  and  the  expenses  of  such
dissolution, liquidation or winding up, the holders of the outstanding shares of
the Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive out of the assets of Farmer Mac
available for distribution to  stockholders,  before any payment or distribution
shall be made on the  Common  Stock or any  other  class or  series  of stock of
Farmer Mac ranking junior to the Preferred Stock upon liquidation, the amount of
$50.00 per share plus an amount,  determined in accordance with Section 2 above,
equal to the amount of any accrued and unpaid  dividends for any prior  Dividend
Periods and for the then-current  Dividend Period through and including the date
of  payment  in  respect of such  dissolution,  liquidation  or winding  up. The
holders of the outstanding  shares of any class or series of stock of Farmer Mac
ranking on a parity with the Preferred Stock upon liquidation  shall be entitled
to  receive  out of the  assets of Farmer  Mac  available  for  distribution  to
stockholders,  before  any such  payment  or  distribution  shall be made on the
Common Stock or any other class or series of stock of Farmer Mac ranking  junior
to  the  Preferred  Stock  and  to  such  parity  stock  upon  liquidation,  any
corresponding preferential amount to which the holders of such parity stock may,
by the terms  thereof,  be entitled;  provided,  however,  that if the assets of
Farmer Mac available for distribution to stockholders  shall be insufficient for
the payment of the full amounts to which the holders of the  outstanding  shares
of the Preferred Stock and the holders of the outstanding  shares of such parity
stock shall be entitled to receive upon such dissolution, liquidation or winding
up of Farmer Mac as aforesaid, then, subject to paragraph (b) of this Section 7,
all of the assets of Farmer Mac available for distribution to stockholders shall
be distributed to the holders of outstanding  shares of the Preferred  Stock and
to the holders of outstanding  shares of such parity stock pro rata, so that the
amounts so distributed to holders of the Preferred  Stock and to holders of such
classes or series of such parity stock,  respectively,  shall bear to each other
the same ratio  that the  respective  distributive  amounts to which they are so
entitled  (including  any  adjustment  due to changes in the  Dividends-Received
Percentage)  bear to each other.  After the payment of the aforesaid  amounts to
which they are  entitled,  the holders of  outstanding  shares of the  Preferred
Stock and the holders of  outstanding  shares of any such parity stock shall not
be entitled to any further participation in any distribution of assets of Farmer
Mac. Solely for purposes of Section 8.4(e)(3) of the Farm Credit Act of 1971, as
amended,  the Preferred  Stock shall be deemed to have a par value of $50.00 per
share.

     (b)  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  upon the dissolution,  liquidation or
winding up of Farmer  Mac,  the  holders of shares of the  Preferred  Stock then
outstanding  shall not be entitled to be paid any amounts to which such  holders
are entitled  pursuant to  paragraph  (a) of this Section 7 unless and until the
holders of any  classes or series of stock of Farmer Mac  ranking  senior to the
Preferred Stock upon liquidation  shall have been paid all amounts to which such
classes or series are entitled pursuant to their respective terms.

     (c) Neither the sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially  all of the
property or business of Farmer Mac, nor the merger, consolidation or combination
of Farmer Mac into or with any other  corporation or entity,  shall be deemed to
be a dissolution, liquidation or winding up for the purpose of this Section 7.

8.  Additional Classes or Series of Stock

     The Board of  Directors  shall  have the right at any time in the future to
authorize,  create  and  issue,  by  resolution  or  resolutions,  one  or  more
additional  classes or series of stock of Farmer Mac, and to  determine  and fix
the  distinguishing   characteristics  and  the  relative  rights,  preferences,
privileges  and other terms of the shares  thereof.  Any such class or series of
stock may rank senior to, on a parity with or junior to the  Preferred  Stock as
to dividends, upon liquidation or otherwise.

9.  Amendments

     Farmer Mac, by or under the authority of the Board of Directors, may amend,
alter,  supplement or repeal any provision of this  Certificate  pursuant to the
following terms and conditions:

          (a) Without the consent of the holders of the Preferred Stock,  Farmer
     Mac  may  amend,  alter,   supplement  or  repeal  any  provision  of  this
     Certificate to cure any  ambiguity,  to correct or supplement any provision
     herein  which may be  defective or  inconsistent  with any other  provision
     herein,  or to make  any  other  provisions  with  respect  to  matters  or
     questions arising under this  Certificate,  provided that such action shall
     not  materially  and  adversely  affect the interests of the holders of the
     Preferred Stock.

          (b) The  consent of the holders of at least  two-thirds  of all of the
     shares of the Preferred Stock at the time  outstanding,  given in person or
     by  proxy,  either in  writing  or by a vote at a  meeting  called  for the
     purpose at which the  holders of shares of the  Preferred  Stock shall vote
     together as a class,  shall be  necessary  for  authorizing,  effecting  or
     validating  the  amendment,  alteration,  supplementation  or repeal of the
     provisions   of   this   Certificate   if   such   amendment,   alteration,
     supplementation or repeal would materially and adversely affect the powers,
     preferences, rights, privileges, qualifications, limitations, restrictions,
     terms or conditions of the Preferred Stock.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing
     sentence,  the 6.40% annual  dividend  rate,  the  redemption  price or the
     liquidation  preference of the Preferred Stock shall not be reduced without
     the unanimous  consent of all shares of the Preferred  Stock.  The creation
     and  issuance  of any other  class or series of stock of Farmer Mac, or the
     issuance of additional  shares of any existing  class or series of stock of
     Farmer Mac (including the Preferred Stock), whether ranking senior to, on a
     parity  with or  junior  to the  Preferred  Stock,  shall  not be deemed to
     constitute such an amendment, alteration, supplementation or repeal.

          (c) Holders of the  Preferred  Stock shall be entitled to one vote per
     share  on  matters  on  which  their   consent  is  required   pursuant  to
     subparagraph  (b) of this Section 9. Consents  shall be effective when duly
     executed and delivered to the  Corporation.  In connection with any meeting
     of such holders,  the Board of Directors  shall fix a record date,  neither
     earlier  than 60 days  nor  later  than 10 days  prior  to the date of such
     meeting,  and  holders of record of shares of the  Preferred  Stock on such
     record date shall be entitled to notice of and to vote at any such  meeting
     and any adjournment.  The Board of Directors,  or such person or persons as
     it may designate,  may establish  reasonable rules and procedures as to the
     solicitation  of the consent of holders of the Preferred  Stock at any such
     meeting or  otherwise,  which  rules and  procedures  shall  conform to the
     requirements  of any national  securities  exchange on which the  Preferred
     Stock may be listed at such time.

10. Priority

      Any stock of any class or series of Farmer Mac shall be deemed to rank:

          (a)  senior  to  the  shares  of the  Preferred  Stock,  either  as to
     dividends or upon liquidation, if the holders of such class or series shall
     be entitled to the receipt of  dividends or of amounts  distributable  upon
     dissolution,  liquidation  or winding up of Farmer Mac, as the case may be,
     in preference or priority to the holders of shares of the Preferred Stock;

          (b) on a parity  with  shares  of the  Preferred  Stock,  either as to
     dividends  or upon  liquidation,  whether  or not  the  dividend  rates  or
     amounts,  dividend  payment dates or redemption of  liquidation  prices per
     share,  if any, be  different  from those of the  Preferred  Stock,  if the
     holders  of such  class or  series  shall be  entitled  to the  receipt  of
     dividends or of amounts  distributable  upon  dissolution,  liquidation  or
     winding  up of  Farmer  Mac,  as the case may be,  in  proportion  to their
     respective  dividend  rates  or  amounts  or  liquidation  prices,  without
     preference or priority,  one over the other, as between the holders of such
     class or series and the holders of shares of the Preferred Stock; and

          (c) junior to shares of the Preferred Stock, either as to dividends or
     upon liquidation,  if such class or series shall be Common Stock, or if the
     holders of shares of the  Preferred  Stock  shall be entitled to receipt of
     dividends or of amounts  distributable  upon  dissolution,  liquidation  or
     winding up of Farmer Mac, as the case may be, in  preference or priority to
     the holders of shares of such class or series.

12. Miscellaneous

     (a) Farmer Mac and any agent of Farmer Mac may deem and treat the holder of
a share or  shares  of  Preferred  Stock,  as shown in  Farmer  Mac's  books and
records,  as the absolute  owner of such share or shares of Preferred  Stock for
the purpose of receiving payment of dividends in respect of such share or shares
of Preferred Stock and for all other purposes whatsoever, and neither Farmer Mac
nor any agent of Farmer Mac shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. All
payments made to or upon the order of any such person shall be valid and, to the
extent  of  the  sum or  sums  so  paid,  effectual  to  satisfy  and  discharge
liabilities  for moneys  payable  by Farmer  Mac on or with  respect to any such
share or shares of Preferred Stock.

interests in shares of Preferred  Stock shall be created or recognized by Farmer
Mac.

     (d) Farmer Mac appoints  American Stock Transfer & Trust Company ("AST") as
its transfer agent,  dividend  disbursing  agent and registrar for the Preferred

forth in the pamphlet  entitled  "Regulations  of the American  Stock Transfer &
Trust  Company."  Such  appointment  shall be for an initial term of three years
from May 1, 2002 and shall  automatically  be renewed for three-year  successive
periods unless terminated by written notice by Farmer Mac or AST.

     (e)  For  purposes  of  this  Certificate,   the  terms  "Farmer  Mac"  and
"Corporation"  mean  the  Federal  Agricultural  Mortgage  Corporation  and  any
successor thereto by operation of law or by reason of a merger, consolidation or
combination.

     (f) This  Certificate  and the respective  rights and obligations of Farmer
Mac and the holders of the Preferred  Stock with respect to such Preferred Stock
shall be  construed  in  accordance  with and governed by the laws of the United
States,  provided  that the law of the  District of Columbia  shall serve as the
federal rule of decision in all instances  except where such law is inconsistent
with Farmer Mac's enabling legislation,  its public purposes or any provision of
this Certificate.

     (g) RECEIPT AND  ACCEPTANCE OF A SHARE OR SHARES OF THE PREFERRED  STOCK BY
OR ON BEHALF OF A HOLDER SHALL  CONSTITUTE THE  UNCONDITIONAL  ACCEPTANCE BY THE
