     The following interim condensed  consolidated  financial  statements of the

financial  statements reflect all normal and recurring  adjustments that are, in
the  opinion  of  management,  necessary  to  present  a fair  statement  of the

believes  that the  disclosures  are  adequate to present  fairly the  condensed
consolidated  financial position,  condensed  consolidated results of operations
and  condensed  consolidated  cash  flows as of the  dates  and for the  periods
presented.  These condensed  consolidated financial statements should be read in
conjunction with the audited 2003  consolidated  financial  statements of Farmer
Mac included in the Corporation's  Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended

Note 1.  Accounting Policies

(a)   Cash and Cash Equivalents

     Farmer Mac considers  highly liquid  investment  securities  with remaining
maturities  of  three  months  or  less  at the  time  of  purchase  to be  cash
equivalents. Changes in the balance of cash and cash equivalents are reported in
the Condensed  Consolidated  Statements of Cash Flows.  The following table sets
forth information regarding certain cash and non-cash transactions for the three
months ended March 31, 2004 and 2003.

</TABLE>

            (b) Allowance for Losses

     As of March 31, 2004,  Farmer Mac maintained a $22.2 million  allowance and
contingent  obligation  for probable  losses  ("allowance  for losses") to cover
estimated  probable losses on loans held for investment,  real estate owned, and
loans underlying post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities and long-term
standby  purchase  commitments   ("LTSPCs")  in  accordance  with  Statement  of
Financial  Accounting  Standard No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies  ("SFAS 5"),
and Statement of Financial  Accounting Standard No. 114, Accounting by Creditors
for  Impairment  of a  Loan,  as  amended  ("SFAS  114").  The  methodology  for
determining  the allowance for losses is the same for loans held for  investment
and loans underlying post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs
because Farmer Mac believes the ultimate credit risk is substantially  the same,
i.e.,  the  underlying  agricultural  mortgage  loans  all meet the same  credit
underwriting and appraisal standards.

     The allowance for losses is increased through periodic  provisions for loan
losses that are charged  against net interest  income and  provisions for losses
that are charged to operating  expense and is reduced by charge-offs  for actual
losses,  net of  recoveries.  Charge-offs  represent  losses on the  outstanding
principal  balance,  any  interest  payment  previously  accrued or advanced and
expected costs of liquidation.

     Farmer Mac estimates probable losses using a systematic process that begins
with  management's  evaluation  of the  results  of its  proprietary  loan  pool
simulation  and  guarantee  fee  model  (the  "Model").  The  Model  draws  upon
historical  information from a data set of agricultural  mortgage loans recorded
over a longer period of time than Farmer Mac's own experience to date,  screened
to include  only those  loans with  credit  characteristics  similar to those on
which Farmer Mac has assumed credit risk. The results generated by the Model are
modified by the  application  of  management's  judgment as required to take key
factors into account, including:

     o    economic conditions;
     o    geographic and agricultural  commodity  concentrations in Farmer Mac's
          portfolio;
     o    the credit profile of Farmer Mac's portfolio;
     o    delinquency trends of Farmer Mac's portfolio;
     o    Farmer  Mac's  experience  in the  management  and sale of real estate
          owned; and
     o    historical charge-off and recovery activities of Farmer
          Mac's portfolio.

     Management  believes that its use of this  methodology  produces a reliable
estimate of total probable  losses,  as of the balance sheet date, for all loans
included in Farmer Mac's  portfolio,  including loans held for investment,  real
estate  owned  and  loans  underlying  post-1996  Act  Farmer  Mac I  Guaranteed
Securities and LTSPCs.

     In  addition,  Farmer  Mac  specifically  analyzes  certain  assets  in its
portfolio  for  impairment  on a  loan-by-loan  basis.  This  analysis  measures
impairment  based  on the  fair  value  of the  underlying  collateral  for each
individual loan relative to the total amount due, including principal,  interest
and  advances  under  SFAS  114.  In the event  that the  updated  appraisal  or
management's  estimate of discounted collateral value does not support the total
amount due, Farmer Mac specifically  allocates an allowance for the loan for the
difference  between the recorded  investment and its fair value,  less estimated
costs to liquidate the collateral.

     For this analysis and the allocation of specific allowances as of March 31,
2004 and  December 31,  2003,  the  population  of loans  specifically  reviewed
included:
     o    non-performing assets (loans 90 days or more past due, in foreclosure,
          restructured,  in bankruptcy - including loans performing under either
          their  original loan term or a  court-approved  bankruptcy  plan - and
          real estate owned);
     o    loans for which  Farmer  Mac had  adjusted  the  timing of  borrowers'
          payment  schedules  within the past three years,  but still expects to
          collect all amounts due and has not made economic concessions; and
     o    additional  performing  loans that have  previously been delinquent or
          are secured by real estate that produces  commodities  currently under
          stress.

     Prior to December 31, 2003,  the review  consisted  only of  non-performing
assets. Management believes that the general allowance,  which is the difference
between the total allowance for losses (generated  through use of the Model) and
the specific allowances,  adequately covers any losses inherent in the portfolio
of performing loans under SFAS 5.

     Farmer Mac's  methodology  for  determining  its  allowance for losses will
migrate  over time  away from the  Model,  to become  based on Farmer  Mac's own
historical portfolio loss experience.  Until that time, Farmer Mac will continue
to use the results from the Model,  augmented by the application of management's
judgment (as described above), to determine its allowance for losses.

     The table below  summarizes  the  components of Farmer Mac's  allowance for
losses,  which includes its contingent  obligation  for probable  losses,  as of
March 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003.

</TABLE>

     No  allowance  for losses has been made for loans  underlying  Farmer Mac I
Guaranteed  Securities issued prior to the Farm Credit System Reform Act of 1996
(the "1996 Act") or securities  issued under the Farmer Mac II program  ("Farmer
Mac II Guaranteed Securities").  Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities issued prior
to the 1996 Act are supported by unguaranteed first loss subordinated interests,
which are expected to exceed the  estimated  credit  losses on those loans.  The
guaranteed portions of loans collateralizing Farmer Mac II Guaranteed Securities
are  guaranteed by the United States  Department of Agriculture  ("USDA").  Each
USDA  guarantee  is an  obligation  backed by the full  faith and  credit of the
United  States.  To date,  Farmer Mac has  experienced  no credit  losses on any
pre-1996  Act  Farmer  Mac I  Guaranteed  Securities  or on  any  Farmer  Mac II
Guaranteed  Securities  and does not  expect  to incur  any such  losses  in the
future.

            (c) Financial Derivatives

     Farmer Mac enters into  financial  derivative  transactions  principally to
protect against risk from the effects of market price or interest rate movements
on the value of certain assets and future cash flows or debt  issuance,  not for
trading or  speculative  purposes.  Farmer Mac enters  into  interest  rate swap
contracts  principally to adjust the  characteristics  of its short-term debt to
match more closely the cash flow and duration characteristics of its longer-term
mortgage  and  other  assets,  and also to  adjust  the  characteristics  of its
long-term debt to match more closely the cash flow and duration  characteristics
of  its  short-term   assets,   thereby  reducing   interest  rate  risk.  These
transactions  also may provide an overall lower effective cost of borrowing than
would otherwise be available in the conventional debt market.

     All financial  derivatives  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value
as  a  freestanding  asset  or  liability.   Financial  derivatives  in  hedging
relationships  that mitigate exposure to changes in the fair value of assets are
considered  fair value hedges.  Financial  derivatives in hedging  relationships
that mitigate the exposure to the  variability in expected  future cash flows or
other  forecasted  transactions  are  considered  cash  flow  hedges.  Financial
derivatives  that do not satisfy the hedging  criteria of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative  Instruments and Hedging
Activities,  as amended ("SFAS 133") are not accounted for as hedges and changes
in the fair  values of those  financial  derivatives  are  reported  as gains or
losses on financial derivatives and trading assets in the condensed consolidated
statements of operations.

     The  following  table  summarizes   information  related  to  Farmer  Mac's
financial derivatives as of March 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003:

</TABLE>

     As of March 31, 2004,  Farmer Mac had  approximately  $58.0  million of net
after-tax  unrealized  losses on cash flow hedges included in accumulated  other
comprehensive income/(loss). These amounts will be reclassified into earnings in
the same  period or  periods  during  which the hedged  forecasted  transactions
(either  the payment of interest  or the  issuance  of  discount  notes)  affect
earnings  or  immediately  when it becomes  probable  that the  original  hedged
forecasted  transaction  will not occur  within  two  months  of the  originally
specified  date.  Over the next twelve  months,  Farmer Mac estimates  that $9.8
million of the amount  currently  reported in  accumulated  other  comprehensive
income/(loss)  will be reclassified  into earnings.  For the quarter ended March
31, 2004,  any  ineffectiveness  related to Farmer Mac's  designated  hedges was
insignificant.

            (d) Earnings Per Common Share

     Basic earnings per common share are based on the weighted-average number of
common shares  outstanding.  Diluted  earnings per common share are based on the
weighted-average  number of common  shares  outstanding  adjusted to include all
potentially  dilutive common stock options.  The following  schedule  reconciles
basic and diluted earnings per common share for the three months ended March 31,
2004 and 2003:

            (e) Stock-Based Compensation

     Farmer Mac accounts for its stock-based  employee  compensation plans using
the intrinsic value method of accounting for employee stock options  pursuant to
Accounting  Principles  Board  Opinion No. 25,  Accounting  for Stock  Issued to
Employees,  and has adopted  the  disclosure-only  provisions  of  Statement  of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,
as amended ("SFAS 123"). Accordingly,  no compensation expense was recognized in
first quarter 2004 or first quarter 2003 for employee stock options.  Had Farmer
Mac  elected to use the fair  value  method of  accounting  for  employee  stock
options,  there  would  have been no effect on net  income  available  to common
stockholders  and  earnings  per share for the three months ended March 31, 2004
and 2003, as no stock options were granted during either period.

     The following table  summarizes  stock option activity for the three months
ended March 31, 2004 and 2003:

            (f) Reclassifications

      Certain reclassifications of prior period information were made to conform
to the current period presentation.

            (g) New Accounting Standards

     In March 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF")  amended EITF 03-01,
The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary  Impairment, to introduce a three-step model
to: 1) determine  whether an  investment  is impaired;  2) evaluate  whether the
impairment  is  other-than-temporary;  and 3) account  for  other-than-temporary
impairments. In part, this amendment requires companies to apply qualitative and
quantitative  measures  to  determine  whether a decline  in the fair value of a
security is  other-than-temporary.  This  amendment is effective  for  financial
periods  beginning after June 15, 2004.  Farmer Mac is evaluating this amendment
and will adopt it beginning in third quarter 2004.

     On January 1, 2003, Farmer Mac adopted the liability recognition provisions
of the Financial  Accounting  Standards Board Interpretation No. 45, Guarantor's
Accounting  and  Disclosure  Requirements  for  Guarantees,  Including  Indirect
Guarantees of  Indebtedness  of Others ("FIN 45"),  which requires Farmer Mac to
recognize,  at the  inception of a guarantee,  a liability for the fair value of
its  obligation  to stand  ready to  perform  under the terms of each  guarantee
agreement  and an asset that is equal to the fair value of the fees that will be
received over the life of each guarantee.  Subsequently,  both the asset and the
liability are measured and recorded at their fair value.  In December  2003, the
Securities and Exchange Commission provided additional guidance on the "day two"
accounting for these  financial  instruments.  In accordance with this guidance,
Farmer  Mac has  adopted  the  amortized  cost  model  for  day  two  accounting
prospectively effective January 1, 2004.

Note 2.  Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities

     Farmer Mac creates Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities through the transfer of
agricultural  mortgage  loans  into  trusts  that are used as  vehicles  for the
securitization  of the  transferred  assets.  The beneficial  interests that are
securitized  are either  retained or sold to third party  investors.  Farmer Mac
records the  beneficial  interests  that it has retained on its balance sheet as
Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities.  As of March 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003,
retained Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities included the following:

     These sensitivities are hypothetical.  As the figures indicate,  changes in
fair value based on a 10 percent  variation in assumptions  generally  cannot be
extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumptions to the change
in fair value may not be linear.  Also,  in this table the effect of a variation
in a  particular  assumption  on the fair  value  of the  retained  interest  is
calculated without changing any other assumption. In fact, changes in one factor
may result in changes in another  (for  example,  increases  in market  interest
rates may result in lower  prepayments),  which might amplify or counteract  the
sensitivities.

     Farmer Mac securitizes two types of assets: agricultural mortgage loans and
USDA-guaranteed  portions. Farmer Mac manages the credit risk of its securitized
agricultural  mortgage loans, both on- and off-balance sheet,  together with its
on-balance sheet agricultural mortgage loans and the agricultural mortgage loans
underlying its off-balance sheet LTSPCs.  Due to the differing interest rate and
funding risk characteristics of on- and off-balance sheet asset classes,  Farmer
Mac  manages  its  on-balance  sheet   agricultural   mortgage  loans  held  and
securitized  differently  from its off-balance  sheet  securitized  agricultural
mortgage loans and  off-balance  sheet  agricultural  mortgage loans  underlying
LTSPCs.

     Farmer Mac separately manages its securitized  USDA-guaranteed portions and
manages  those  held on its  balance  sheet  differently  from  those  that  are
off-balance  sheet - also due to their differing  interest rate and funding risk
characteristics.

     As part of fulfilling its guarantee obligations for Farmer Mac I Guaranteed
Securities and commitments to purchase eligible loans underlying LTSPCs,  Farmer
Mac purchases  defaulted  loans, all of which are at least 90 days delinquent at
the time of  purchase,  out of those  securities  and  pools,  and  records  the
purchased loans as such on its balance sheet.

     The  table  below  presents  the  outstanding  principal  balances,  90-day
delinquencies and net credit losses as of and for the periods indicated for each
managed asset class, both on- and off-balance sheet.

Note 3.  Off-Balance Sheet Guarantees and Long-Term Standby Purchase Commitments


Overview

     Farmer Mac offers  approved  agricultural  and rural  residential  mortgage
lenders two  off-balance  sheet  alternatives  to increase  their  liquidity  or
lending  capacity  while  retaining the cash flow  benefits of their loans:  (1)
Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities,  which are available through either the Farmer
Mac I program or the Farmer Mac II program,  and (2) LTSPCs, which are available
only  through  the Farmer Mac I program.  Both of these  alternatives  result in
off-balance sheet transactions for Farmer Mac.

     To be eligible for the Farmer Mac I program,  a loan must meet Farmer Mac's
credit underwriting, appraisal and documentation standards.

Off-Balance Sheet Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities

     Periodically Farmer Mac transfers  agricultural  mortgage loans into trusts
that are used as vehicles for the  securitization of the transferred  assets and
the beneficial  interests in the trusts are sold to third party  investors.  The
table  below  summarizes  certain  cash  flows  received  from and paid to these
trusts.

     Farmer Mac is liable under its guarantee to ensure that the securities make
timely  payments to investors of principal and interest  based on the underlying
loans, regardless of whether the trust has actually received such scheduled loan
payments.  As  consideration  for Farmer Mac's  assumption of the credit risk on
these mortgage  pass-through  certificates,  Farmer Mac receives  guarantee fees
that are  recognized as earned on an accrual basis over the life of the loan and
based upon the outstanding balance of the Farmer Mac Guaranteed Security.

Farmer Mac is required to perform under its obligation when the underlying loans
for the  off-balance  sheet Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities do not make their
scheduled installment payments. When a loan underlying a Farmer Mac I Guaranteed
Security  becomes  90 days  or more  past  due,  Farmer  Mac  may,  in its  sole
discretion,  repurchase  the loan from the trust and generally  does  repurchase
such loans, thereby reducing the principal balance of the outstanding Farmer Mac
I Guaranteed Security.

     The  following  table  presents the maximum  principal  amount of potential
undiscounted  future  payments  that  Farmer Mac could be required to make under
off-balance  sheet  Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities  as of March 31, 2004 and
December 31, 2003, not including  offsets  provided by any recourse  provisions,
recoveries from third parties or collateral for the underlying loans.

     If Farmer  Mac  repurchases  a loan that is  collateral  for a Farmer Mac I
Guaranteed Security, Farmer Mac would have the right to enforce the terms of the
loan and,  in the  event of a  default,  would  have  access  to the  underlying
collateral.  Farmer Mac typically recovers a significant portion of the value of
defaulted  loans  purchased  either  through  borrower  payments,  loan payoffs,
payments by third parties or foreclosure and sale of the collateral.

     Farmer Mac has  recourse  to the USDA for amounts  advanced  for the timely
payment of principal and interest on Farmer Mac II Guaranteed  Securities.  That
recourse is the USDA guarantee, a full faith and credit obligation of the United
States  that  becomes   enforceable   if  a  lender  fails  to  repurchase   the
USDA-guaranteed  portion from its owner within 30 days after written demand from
the owner when (a) the borrower under the guaranteed loan is in default not less
than  60  days  in  the  payment  of  any  principal  or  interest  due  on  the
USDA-guaranteed  portion, or (b) the lender has failed to remit to the owner the
payment made by the borrower on the USDA-guaranteed  portion or any related loan
subsidy within 30 days after the lender's receipt of the payment.

     As of March 31, 2004, the weighted-average  remaining maturity of all loans
underlying  off-balance  sheet Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities was 16.3 years.
For the off-balance sheet Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities that were executed
on or before  December  31,  2002,  Farmer Mac has  recorded  an  allowance  for
probable  losses of $1.0  million  as of March 31,  2004 and $1.1  million as of
December 31, 2003. For those securities that were issued or modified on or after
January  1,  2003,  Farmer  Mac has  recorded  the  fair  value  of its  initial
obligation  to stand ready under the  guarantee as a liability.  This  liability
approximated  $3.8  million as of March 31, 2004 and $4.1 million as of December
31, 2003 and is reported  in the  guarantee  and  commitment  obligation  on the
condensed consolidated balance sheet.

Long-Term Standby Purchase Commitments (LTSPCs)

     An LTSPC is a commitment by Farmer Mac to purchase  eligible loans,  either
for cash or in exchange for Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities,  on one or more
undetermined  future dates. In consideration  for Farmer Mac's assumption of the
credit risk on loans  underlying an LTSPC,  Farmer Mac receives a commitment fee
payable monthly in arrears, in an amount  approximating what would have been the
guarantee  fee if the  transaction  were  structured  as a swap for  Farmer  Mac
Guaranteed Securities.

     An LTSPC permits a seller to nominate from its portfolio a segregated  pool
of loans,  which are  retained in the  seller's  portfolio  and  serviced by the
seller.  Upon  nomination,  Farmer Mac reviews the loan pool to confirm  that it
conforms  to Farmer  Mac's  credit  underwriting,  appraisal  and  documentation
standards.  Upon Farmer  Mac's  acceptance  of the  eligible  loans,  the seller
effectively  transfers  the credit risk on those  loans to Farmer  Mac,  thereby
reducing the seller's credit and concentration exposures and, consequently,  its
regulatory capital requirements and loan loss reserve requirements.  Credit risk
is transferred  through Farmer Mac's commitment to purchase the segregated loans
from the  counterparty  based  upon  Farmer  Mac's  original  credit  review and
acceptance of the credit risk on the loans.

     The  specific  events or  circumstances  that would  require  Farmer Mac to
purchase some or all of the segregated  loans under its LTSPCs include:  (1) the
failure of the borrower under any loan to make  installment  payments under that
loan for a period  of at least  four  months;  or (2) the  determination  by the
holder of the  LTSPC to sell some or all of the loans  under the LTSPC to Farmer
Mac.

     As of March 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, the maximum principal amount of
potential  undiscounted  future  payments  that Farmer Mac could be requested to
make under LTSPCs,  not including  offsets provided by any recourse  provisions,
recoveries from third parties or collateral for the underlying  loans,  was $2.4
billion and $2.3 billion, respectively.

     In the event of loan  default,  Farmer  Mac would have the right to enforce
the terms of the loans  including  the right to  foreclose  upon the  collateral
underlying  such loans.  Farmer Mac believes  that it will  generally  recover a
significant portion of the value of the defaulted loans purchased either through
borrower  payments,  loan payoffs,  payments by third parties or foreclosure and
sale of the  collateral.  For all LTSPC  transactions  to date,  Farmer  Mac has
incurred a charge-off on one loan.

     As of March 31, 2004, the weighted-average  remaining maturity of all loans
underlying LTSPCs was 14.6 years. For the LTSPCs that were executed on or before
December 31, 2002,  Farmer Mac has recorded an allowance for probable  losses of
$8.6 million as of March 31, 2004 and $9.2 million as of December 31, 2003.  For
those  LTSPCs that were issued or modified on or after  January 1, 2003,  Farmer
Mac has recorded the fair value of its initial  obligation  to stand ready under
the commitment as a liability.  This liability  approximated  $7.5 million as of
March 31, 2004 and $7.3  million as of December 31, 2003 and was included in the
guarantee and commitment obligation on the condensed consolidated balance sheet.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
        Results of Operations

Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

     Certain  statements  made in this report are  "forward-looking  statements"
within  the  meaning of the  Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform Act of 1995
pertaining  to  management's  current  expectations  as to Farmer  Mac's  future
financial results, business prospects and business developments. Forward-looking
statements  include,  without  limitation,   any  statement  that  may  predict,
forecast,  indicate or imply future results,  performance or  achievements,  and
typically are accompanied by, and identified with, such terms as  "anticipates,"
"believes,"  "expects,"  "intends," "should" and similar phrases.  The following
management's  discussion  and  analysis  includes   forward-looking   statements
addressing Farmer Mac's:
     o    prospects for earnings;
     o    growth in loan purchase, guarantee, LTSPC and securitization volume;
     o    trends in net interest income;
     o    trends in provisions for losses;
     o    changes in capital position; and
     o    other business and financial matters.

     Management's  expectations  for Farmer Mac's future  necessarily  involve a
number  of   assumptions   and  estimates  and  the   evaluation  of  risks  and
uncertainties. Various factors could cause Farmer Mac's actual results or events
to differ  materially  from the  expectations  as  expressed  or  implied by the
forward-looking statements, including uncertainties regarding:
     o    the rate and  direction of  development  of the  secondary  market for
          agricultural mortgage loans;
     o    the possible  establishment  of  additional  statutory  or  regulatory

          its profitability;
     o    legislative or regulatory  developments or  interpretations  of Farmer
          Mac's statutory  charter that could adversely affect Farmer Mac or the
          ability  or  motivation  of  certain  lenders  to  participate  in its

     The foregoing factors are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report may
include additional factors that could adversely affect Farmer Mac's business and
its financial  performance.  Furthermore,  new risk factors  emerge from time to
time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor
assess the  effects of such  factors on Farmer  Mac's  business or the extent to
which any factor, or combination of factors,  may cause actual results to differ
materially  from the  expectations  expressed or implied by the  forward-looking
statements.  In light of  these  potential  risks  and  uncertainties,  no undue
reliance should be placed on any  forward-looking  statements  expressed in this
report. Furthermore, Farmer Mac undertakes no obligation to release publicly the
results  of  revisions  to any  forward-looking  statements  that may be made to
reflect any future events or circumstances,  except as otherwise mandated by the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

     The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with
accounting  principles  generally accepted in the United States requires the use
of estimates and assumptions  that affect the amounts  reported in the condensed
consolidated  financial  statements and related notes for the periods presented.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. The critical accounting policy
that is both important to the portrayal of Farmer Mac's financial  condition and
results  of  operations  and  requires  complex,  subjective  judgments  is  the
accounting  policy for the  allowance  for losses.  Farmer Mac's  allowance  for
losses is presented as follows on its consolidated balance sheet:

     o    an "Allowance for loan losses" on loans held for investment;
     o    a valuation  allowance on real estate owned,  which is included in the
          balance sheet under "Real estate owned, net of valuation allowance";
     o    an allowance for losses on loans underlying post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I
          Guaranteed  Securities  and  LTSPCs  entered  into or  modified  after
          January 1, 2003,  which is included in the balance  sheet as a portion
          of the amount reported as "Guarantee and commitment obligation"; and
     o    an allowance for losses on loans underlying post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I
          Guaranteed  Securities  and  LTSPCs  entered  into prior to January 1,
          2003,  which is  included  in the balance  sheet  under  "Reserve  for
          losses."

     The purpose of the allowance for losses is to provide for estimated  losses
that are probable to have occurred as of the balance sheet date,  not to predict
or account for future potential  losses.  The determination of the allowance for
losses requires  management to make  significant  estimates based on information
available  as of the  balance  sheet date,  including  the amounts and timing of
losses and current market and economic  conditions.  These estimates are subject
to change in future reporting periods if such conditions and information change.
For example, a continued decline in the national or agricultural economies could
result in an  increase  in  delinquencies  or  foreclosures,  which may  require
additional allowances for losses in future periods.

     Farmer Mac  maintains an allowance for losses to cover  estimated  probable
losses on loans held for  investment,  real  estate  owned and loans  underlying
post-1996  Act  Farmer  Mac I  Guaranteed  Securities  and  LTSPCs.  Farmer  Mac
estimates   probable  losses  using  a  systematic   process  that  begins  with
management's  evaluation of the results of its proprietary  loan pool simulation
and  guarantee  fee  model  (the  "Model").  The  Model  draws  upon  historical
information  from a data set of  agricultural  mortgage  loans  recorded  over a
longer  period of time than Farmer  Mac's own  experience  to date,  screened to
include only those loans with credit  characteristics  similar to those on which
Farmer Mac has  assumed  credit  risk.  The results  generated  by the Model are
modified by the  application  of  management's  judgment as required to take key
factors into account, including:

     o    economic conditions;
     o    geographic and agricultural  commodity  concentrations in Farmer Mac's
          portfolio;
     o    the credit profile of Farmer Mac's portfolio;
     o    delinquency trends of Farmer Mac's portfolio;
     o    Farmer  Mac's  experience  in the  management  and sale of real estate
          owned; and
     o    historical   charge-off  and  recovery   activities  of  Farmer  Mac's
          portfolio.

     The allowance for losses is increased through periodic  provisions for loan
losses that are charged  against net interest  income and  provisions for losses
that are charged to  operating  expense and  reduced by  charge-offs  for actual
losses, net of recoveries.  The establishment of and periodic adjustments to the
REO valuation allowance are charged against income as a portion of the provision
for losses charged to operating  expense.  Charge-offs  represent  losses on the
outstanding  principal  balance,  any interest  payments  previously  accrued or
advanced and expected costs of liquidation. Gains and losses on the sale of real
estate owned are recorded in income based on the difference between the recorded
investment at the time of sale and liquidation proceeds.

     No  allowance  for losses has been made for loans  underlying  Farmer Mac I
Guaranteed  Securities  issued prior to the 1996 Act or Farmer Mac II Guaranteed
Securities.  Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities issued prior to the 1996 Act are
supported by unguaranteed first loss subordinated interests,  which are expected
to exceed the estimated credit losses on those loans.  USDA-guaranteed  portions
collateralizing  Farmer Mac II Guaranteed  Securities are obligations  backed by
the full  faith  and  credit  of the  United  States.  To date,  Farmer  Mac has
experienced  no credit  losses  on any  pre-1996  Act  Farmer  Mac I  Guaranteed
Securities or on any Farmer Mac II Guaranteed  Securities and does not expect to
incur any such losses in the future.

     Further  information  regarding  the  allowance  for losses is  included in
"--Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Management--Credit
Risk."

Results of Operations

     Overview.  Net income  available to common  stockholders  for first quarter
2004 was $7.8  million  or $0.64 per  diluted  common  share,  compared  to $8.4
million or $0.70 per diluted  common share for first quarter 2003.  During first
quarter 2004, Farmer Mac:

     o    added $147.3 million of Farmer Mac I eligible loans under LTSPCs;
     o    purchased  $25.4  million  of newly  originated  Farmer Mac I eligible
          loans;  and
     o    purchased  $34.5  million  of Farmer Mac II  eligible  USDA-guaranteed
          portions of loans.

     USDA is currently  forecasting  national  farm cash receipts to increase to
$215.0 billion in 2004 from the $212.4 billion  forecasted level in 2003. Prices
available to farmers have been rising as a result of strong domestic and foreign
demand.  Forecasted net cash income on farms for 2004 is $55.9  billion,  a $7.1
billion decrease from 2003 forecasted levels of $63.0 billion,  but still higher
than the $49.1 billion level of 2002.  The  forecasted  net cash income on farms
for 2004 includes  government  payments of $10.3  billion,  as compared to $17.4
billion in 2003 and $11.0 billion in 2002.

     Despite  the  decline  in farm  income in 2004,  the rise in farm  business
assets,  debt, and equity values is expected to continue  through the end of the
year.  USDA  forecasts  the value of U.S.  farm real  estate  assets to rise 3.5
percent to $1.13  trillion in 2004,  up from 2003's $1.09  trillion.  Total farm
real estate debt is expected to approach  $116.5  billion by the end of 2004,  a
4.7 percent  increase over the 2003 level.  This more moderate rise in farm real
estate  debt  follows  growth of 7.7  percent  in 2003 and 7.7  percent in 2002.
Sector  equity is  expected  to rise more than 3  percent,  as the gain in asset
values exceeds the increase in debt by approximately $36 billion.

     The financial  measures  reflect farm  investors'  and lenders'  collective
decisions about the long-term  expected  profitability  of farm  investments and
agriculture  generally.  These expectations should be favorable for Farmer Mac's
business  plans,  as they indicate  increased U.S. farm real estate  values,  an
expanding  mortgageable farm real estate base, and a stronger equity position in
U.S. agriculture, which should in the aggregate improve Farmer Mac'Ss ability to
recover in foreclosures.


     Set forth below is a more  detailed  discussion  of Farmer Mac's results of
operations.

     Net Interest Income. Net interest income,  which does not include guarantee
fees for loans purchased prior to April 1, 2001 (the effective date of Statement
of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  140,  Accounting  for  Transfers  and
Servicing of Financial Assets and  Extinguishments of Liabilities ("SFAS 140")),
was $9.5  million for first  quarter  2004,  compared to $9.9  million for first
quarter  2003.  The net interest  yield was 93 basis points for the three months
ended March 31,  2004,  compared to 99 basis  points for the three  months ended
March 31, 2003. The effect of the adoption of SFAS 140 was a reclassification of
approximately $1.1 million (10 basis points) of guarantee fee income as interest
income for the three months  ended March 31, 2004,  compared to $1.1 million (11
basis points) for the three months ended March 31, 2003.

     In  2003,  the  Chief  Accountant  at  the  U.S.  Securities  and  Exchange
Commission  provided  additional  guidance  to  all  registrants  regarding  the
classification  on the  statement  of  operations  of realized  gains and losses
resulting  from  financial  derivatives  that are not in fair value or cash flow
hedge relationships. All registrants were requested to comply with this guidance
in  future  filings  and to  reclassify  this  activity  for all  prior  periods
presented.  As a result of the application of this additional guidance,  the net
interest income and expense  realized on financial  derivatives  that are not in
fair  value or cash flow hedge  relationships  have been  reclassified  from net
interest  income  into gains and losses on  financial  derivatives  and  trading
assets.   For  the  three   months   ended  March  31,   2004  and  2003,   this
reclassification  resulted in the decrease of the net interest  yield of 4 basis
points and an increase of 4 basis points, respectively.

     The net  interest  yields  for first  quarter  2004 and 2003  included  the
benefits of yield maintenance  payments received of 11 basis points and 14 basis
points, respectively.  Yield maintenance payments represent the present value of
expected  future  interest  income  streams and  accelerate  the  recognition of
interest income from the related loans.  Because the timing and amounts of these
payments  vary  greatly,  variations  should  not be  considered  indicative  of
positive or negative  trends to gauge future  financial  results.  For the three
months ended March 31, 2004 and 2003, the effects of yield maintenance  payments
on net  income and  diluted  earnings  per share were $0.8  million or $0.06 per
diluted share and $0.9 million or $0.07 per diluted share, respectively.

     The following table provides information regarding the average balances and
rates of  interest-earning  assets and funding for the three  months ended March
31, 2004 and 2003. The balance of non-accruing  loans is included in the average
balance  of  interest-earning  loans  presented,  though  no  related  income is
included in the income figures presented. The decreases in the average rates for
cash and cash equivalents  reflect their short-term nature. The decreases in the
average rates for  investments  and loans and Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities
reflect the  relatively  large  proportion  of  adjustable  rates in those asset
categories (71.5 percent of investments and 65.1 percent of loans and Farmer Mac
Guaranteed Securities). The decrease in the average rate for discount notes also
reflects their short-term  nature. The decreases in all of these rates track the
general decrease in market rates between the two periods.

</TABLE>

     Guarantee and  Commitment  Fees.  Guarantee and  commitment  fees were $5.2
million for first quarter 2004, compared to $5.1 million for first quarter 2003.
The  increase  in  guarantee  and  commitment  fees  reflects an increase in the
average  balance  of  outstanding  guarantees  and  LTSPCs.  The  effects of the
adoption of SFAS 140 reclassified  $1.1 million and $1.1 million,  respectively,
of  guarantee  fee income as interest  income for first  quarter  2004 and first
quarter 2003,  although  management  considers the amount to have been earned in
consideration  for the assumption of credit risk. That portion of the difference
or  "spread"  between  the cost of Farmer  Mac's debt  funding for loans and the
yield on  post-1996  Act Farmer Mac I  Guaranteed  Securities  held on its books
compensates  for credit and interest  rate risk. If a post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I
Guaranteed  Security is sold to a third party,  Farmer Mac  continues to receive
the guarantee fee component of that spread, which continues to compensate Farmer
Mac  for  its  assumption  of  credit  risk.  The  portion  of the  spread  that
compensates  for interest rate risk would not typically  continue to be received
by Farmer Mac, except to the extent  attributable to any retained  interest-only
strip, if the asset were sold.

     Farmer Mac's  ongoing  guarantee  and  commitment  fee income  reflects the
annuity-like revenue stream of that aspect of the Corporation's  business.  That
fee  income  is  earned  on the  cumulative  outstanding  principal  balance  of
guaranteed  securities and loans underlying LTSPCs.  Accordingly,  GAAP earnings
increase or decrease  through changes in periodic  business volume in proportion
to  the  change  in  that  cumulative  outstanding  principal  balance,  not  in
proportion to the change in periodic volume.

     Expenses.  Compensation  and employee  benefits for first quarter 2004 were
$1.8  million,  compared to $1.4  million for first  quarter  2003.  General and
administrative  expenses for first quarter 2004 were $2.1  million,  compared to
$1.2 million for first quarter 2003. The increases in compensation  and employee
benefits and general and  administrative  expenses  were due, in large part,  to
increased  staffing  levels  necessary  for  increased   regulatory   compliance
activities,  including requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Farmer
Mac's federal  regulator,  the Farm Credit  Administration  ("FCA"),  as well as
heightened  focus  on  the  regulatory   environment  for   government-sponsored
enterprises  generally.  Regulatory  fees assessed by FCA for first quarter 2004
and 2003  were $0.4  million.  FCA has  advised  Farmer  Mac that its  estimated
assessment  level for the year ending  September  30, 2004 will be $1.7 million.
After the end of a federal government fiscal year, FCA may revise its prior year
estimated  assessments  to reflect  actual costs  incurred,  and has issued both
additional assessments and refunds in the past.

     Farmer Mac's total  provision for losses was $1.6 million for first quarter
2004, compared to $2.2 million for first quarter 2003. (See  "--Quantitative and
Qualitative   Disclosures  About  Market  Risk   Management--Credit   Risk"  for
additional information regarding Farmer Mac's provision for losses and provision
for loan losses.) As of March 31, 2004,  Farmer Mac's total allowance for losses
totaled  $22.2  million,  or 0.45  percent  of  outstanding  loans held or loans
underlying post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs, compared
to $22.1  million (0.44 percent of  outstanding  loans held or loans  underlying
post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities and LTSPCs) as of December 31,
2003.

     Gains on Financial  Derivatives and Trading Assets. For first quarter 2004,
the gain on financial derivatives and trading assets was $3.2 million,  compared
to a gain of $3.3 million for first  quarter  2003.  The gains in first  quarter
2004 and first quarter 2003 resulted  primarily  from  fluctuations  in the fair
values of financial  derivatives  that have not been  designated  in either fair
value or cash flow hedge relationships.

     Non-GAAP Performance Measures.  Farmer Mac reports its financial results in
accordance with GAAP. In addition to GAAP measures,  Farmer Mac presents certain
non-GAAP  performance  measures.  Farmer  Mac uses  these  non-GAAP  performance
measures to develop  financial plans, to measure corporate  performance,  and to
set incentive compensation. As described below, because FASB has adopted a mixed
attribute  accounting model that does not reflect the economics for transactions
involving  Farmer  Mac's  callable  swaps,  in  management's  view the  non-GAAP
measures  provide  a more  accurate  representation  of  Farmer  Mac's  economic
performance,  transaction  economics  and  business  trends.  Investors  and the
investment  analyst  community have previously  relied upon similar  measures to
evaluate  performance and issue projections.  These non-GAAP disclosures are not
intended to replace GAAP information but, rather, to supplement it.

     One such non-GAAP  measure is core earnings,  which Farmer Mac developed to
present net income less the after-tax effects of SFAS 133. Core earnings for the
three  months ended March 31, 2004 were $5.9  million,  compared to $5.9 million
for the three months ended March 31, 2003. The reconciliation of GAAP net income
available to common  stockholders to core earnings is presented in the following

     Business Volume.  Loans are brought into the Farmer Mac I and Farmer Mac II
programs as follows:

     o    Farmer Mac purchases  eligible loans and guarantees timely payments of
          principal and interest of securities  backed by those loans as part of
          the Farmer Mac I program.  Farmer Mac may retain  some or all of those
          securities  in its  portfolio or sell them to third parties in capital
          markets transactions.
     o    Farmer Mac purchases  USDA-guaranteed portions of loans and guarantees
          timely  payments of  principal  and interest of  securities  backed by
          those guaranteed portions as part of the Farmer Mac II program. Farmer
          Mac may retain some or all of those  securities  in its  portfolio  or
          sell them to third parties in capital markets transactions.
     o    Farmer Mac also enters into LTSPCs for  eligible  loans.  Farmer Mac's
          commitments through LTSPCs include either newly originated or seasoned
          eligible loans, and are part of the Farmer Mac I program.
     o    Farmer Mac exchanges  Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities  for eligible
          loans or  USDA-guaranteed  portions of loans  ("swaps").  Farmer Mac's
          swaps of Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities for USDA-guaranteed portions
          of loans are part of the Farmer Mac II program;  Farmer Mac's swaps of
          Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities for any other eligible loans are part
          of the Farmer Mac I program.

     The  following  table  sets forth the amount of all Farmer Mac I and Farmer
Mac II loan purchase and guarantee  activities for newly  originated and current
seasoned loans during the periods indicated.

     The purchase  price of newly  originated  and seasoned  eligible  loans and
portfolios purchased by Farmer Mac (none of which were delinquent at the time of
purchase) is the fair value based on current  market  interest  rates and Farmer
Mac's target net yield,  which  includes an amount to compensate  Farmer Mac for
credit risk that is similar to the guarantee or  commitment  fee it receives for
accepting credit risk on loans underlying  post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed
Securities  and LTSPCs.  As part of  fulfilling  its guarantee  obligations  for
Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities and assumption of credit risk on commitments
to purchase  eligible loans underlying  LTSPCs,  Farmer Mac purchases  defaulted
loans (all of which are at least 90 days delinquent at the time of purchase) out
of those  securities and pools. The purchase price for defaulted loans purchased
out of Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities is the current outstanding  principal
balance of the loan plus accrued and unpaid  interest.  The  purchase  price for
defaulted loans purchased  under an LTSPC is the current  outstanding  principal
balance of the loan,  with accrued and unpaid  interest on the  defaulted  loans
payable out of any future loan payments or liquidation  proceeds  received.  The
following  table presents  Farmer Mac's loan  purchases of newly  originated and
current  seasoned loans and defaulted  loans purchased  underlying  Farmer Mac I
Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs.

     To fulfill its guarantee and commitment  obligations,  Farmer Mac purchases
delinquent loans  underlying  Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities and LTSPCs.  The
decreases in defaulted  loans  purchased and in defaulted  loans  transferred to
loans  reflect a  reduction  in newly  delinquent  loans  underlying  Farmer Mac
Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs.

     The  weighted-average  age of the Farmer Mac I newly originated and current
seasoned  loans  purchased  during first quarter 2004 and first quarter 2003 was
less than one month and 1.8  months,  respectively.  Of the  Farmer  Mac I newly
originated and current  seasoned loans  purchased  during first quarter 2004 and
first  quarter  2003,  70 percent and 77 percent,  respectively,  had  principal
amortization  periods  longer  than the  maturity  date,  resulting  in  balloon
payments at maturity, with a weighted-average remaining term to maturity of 15.2
years and 15.3 years, respectively. The weighted-average age of delinquent loans
purchased  out of  securitized  pools and LTSPCs  during first  quarter 2004 and
first quarter 2003 was 6.7 years and 4.8 years, respectively.

     Indicators of future loan purchase and guarantee  volume (but not of future
LTSPC,  swap  or  portfolio  purchase  volume)  in  the  immediately  succeeding
reporting period include  outstanding  commitments to purchase loans (other than
under an  LTSPC)  and the total  balance  of loans  submitted  for  approval  or
approved but not yet purchased. Many purchase commitments entered into by Farmer
Mac  are  mandatory  delivery  commitments.  If a  seller  obtains  a  mandatory
commitment and is unable to deliver the loans as required thereunder, Farmer Mac
requires the seller to pay a fee to modify, extend or cancel the commitment.  As
of March 31,  2004,  outstanding  commitments  to  purchase  Farmer  Mac I loans
totaled $2.3  million,  compared to $15.1  million as of March 31, 2003.  Of the
total Farmer Mac I commitments  outstanding as of March 31, 2004 and 2003,  $2.3
million  and $5.8  million,  respectively,  were  mandatory  commitments.  Loans
submitted  for  approval or approved but not yet  committed to purchase  totaled
$25.4  million as of March 31, 2004,  compared to $67.3  million as of March 31,
2003.  Not all of these  loans will be  purchased,  as some will  ultimately  be
denied for credit reasons or withdrawn by the seller.

     New business volume for first quarter 2004 was $207.2  million,  down $60.3
million from the same period in 2003. Presently,  Farmer Mac's new business with
agricultural mortgage lenders has been slowed by:

     o    reduced growth rates in the agricultural mortgage market;
     o    increased capital and liquidity at those agricultural mortgage lenders
          in the current interest rate and regulatory environments; and
     o    increased regulatory pressure on government-sponsored enterprises.

     The Farm Credit System Insurance  Corporation (a U.S. Government controlled
corporation managed by a three-member board of directors composed of the members
of the FCA Board) has indicated that Farm Credit System  institutions  should be
cautious about the risk of doing business with government-sponsored enterprises,
including Farmer Mac, and has raised  objections to those  institutions'  use of
Farmer Mac swaps because they generate  Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities  not
subject to its insurance premiums.  Notwithstanding these circumstances,  Farmer
Mac  continues to see  promising  new  business  opportunities,  with  marketing
initiatives  advanced by new and expanded  business  relationships,  including a
strategic alliance, product enhancements and refined security structures.


     While significant progress has been made in developing the secondary market
for  agricultural  mortgages,  Farmer Mac  continues to face the  challenges  of
establishing a market where none previously existed.  Acceptance of Farmer Mac's
programs is based upon the competitive rates, terms and products offered and the
advantages  Farmer  Mac  believes  its  programs  provide,  including  increased
liquidity and lending  capacity.  As of March 31, 2004, Farmer Mac's outstanding
program volume was $5.7 billion,  which represented  approximately 13 percent of
management's  estimate  of a  $44.5  billion  market  of  eligible  agricultural
mortgage loans. For Farmer Mac to succeed in realizing its business  development
and  profitability  objectives  over the longer  term,  the use of Farmer  Mac's
programs and products by agricultural  mortgage lenders,  whether traditional or
non-traditional, must continue to expand.

     As of March 31, 2004,  there were 160  approved  loan sellers in the Farmer
Mac I program ranging from single-office to multi-branch institutions,  spanning
community banks,  Farm Credit System  associations,  mortgage  companies,  large
multi-state Farm Credit System banks,  commercial banks and insurance companies.
During  2003,  there were 81 approved  loan  sellers  active in the Farmer Mac I
program. In addition to participating directly in the Farmer Mac I program, some
of the approved loan sellers enable other lenders to  participate  indirectly in
the Farmer Mac I program by  managing  correspondent  networks  of lenders  from
which they purchase loans to sell to Farmer Mac. As of March 31, 2004, more than
75 lenders were participating in those networks, bringing the total Farmer Mac I
program participants to more than 200 as of March 31, 2004.

     Any lender  authorized by the USDA to obtain a USDA guarantee on a loan may
be a seller in the Farmer Mac II program.  As of March 31, 2004,  there were 145
active sellers in the Farmer Mac II program,  compared to 150 as of December 31,
2003 and 132 as of March 31, 2003.  Sellers in the Farmer Mac II program consist
mostly of community and regional banks.

     In the aggregate,  more than 300 lenders were actively participating either
directly  or  indirectly  in one or both of the  Farmer  Mac I or Farmer  Mac II
programs as of March 31, 2004.

Balance Sheet Review

     During the three  months ended March 31,  2004,  total assets  decreased by
$354.1 million from December 31, 2003,  with decreases in program assets (Farmer
Mac Guaranteed  Securities and loans) of $97.5 million.  For further information
regarding off-balance sheet program activities, see "--Off-Balance Sheet Program
Activities"  below.  Consistent  with the  decrease in total  assets  during the
period, total liabilities  decreased by $354.6 million from December 31, 2003 to
March 31, 2004.

     During  the  three  months  ended  March  31,   2004,   accumulated   other
comprehensive  income/(loss)  decreased $7.6 million, which is the net after-tax
effect of a $7.4 million  increase in unrealized  gains on securities  available
for sale and a $19.1 million decrease in the fair value of financial derivatives
classified as cash flow hedges. Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) is
not a component of Farmer Mac's core capital or regulatory capital.

     As of March 31 2004,  Farmer Mac's core  capital  totaled  $223.7  million,
compared to $215.5  million as of December 31, 2003. As of March 31, 2004,  core
capital  exceeded Farmer Mac's statutory  minimum capital  requirement of $132.1
million by $91.6 million.

     FCA issued its final risk-based  capital regulation for Farmer Mac on April
12,  2001.  Farmer Mac was  required to meet the  risk-based  capital  standards
beginning on May 23, 2002. The risk-based capital stress test promulgated by FCA
is intended to determine  the amount of  regulatory  capital  (core capital plus
allowance  for losses) that Farmer Mac would need to maintain  positive  capital
during a ten-year period in which:

     o    losses occur at a rate of default and severity "reasonably related" to
          the  rates of the  highest  sequential  two  years in a  limited  U.S.
          geographic area; and
     o    there is an  initial  interest  rate  shock at the lesser of 600 basis
          points or 50 percent of the ten-year U.S.  Treasury rate, and interest
          rates remain at such level for the remainder of the period.

The  risk-based  capital  stress test then adds an  additional 30 percent to the
resulting capital requirement for management and operational risk.

     Farmer Mac was in compliance  with the risk-based  capital  standards under
the  regulation  as of March 31,  2004.  As of March 31,  2004,  the  risk-based
capital stress test generated a regulatory capital requirement of $42.1 million.
Farmer  Mac's  regulatory  capital of $245.7  million  exceeded  that  amount by
approximately $203.6 million. The increase in the risk-based capital requirement
from December 31, 2003 ($38.8  million) to March 31, 2004 ($42.1  million) was a
result of changes in the interest  rate  environment.  Farmer Mac is required to
hold capital at the higher of the statutory  minimum capital  requirement or the
amount required by the risk-based capital stress test.

Off-Balance Sheet Program Activities

     Farmer Mac offers  approved  agricultural  and rural  residential  mortgage
lenders two  off-balance  sheet  alternatives  to increase  their  liquidity  or
lending  capacity  while  retaining the cash flow  benefits of their loans:  (1)
Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities,  which are available through either the Farmer
Mac I program or the Farmer Mac II program,  and (2) LTSPCs, which are available
only  through  the Farmer Mac I program.  Both of these  alternatives  result in
off-balance sheet transactions for Farmer Mac.

     To be eligible for the Farmer Mac I program,  a loan must meet Farmer Mac's
credit underwriting,  appraisal and documentation standards. Accordingly, Farmer
Mac  believes  the  ultimate  credit risk it assumes  for Farmer Mac  Guaranteed
Securities  backed by loans that are  eligible  for the Farmer Mac I program and
for LTSPCs is  substantially  the same and  considers the effects of all on- and
off-balance sheet activities on its overall portfolio diversification and credit
risk. See Note 3 to Farmer Mac's  condensed  consolidated  financial  statements
above for more detail on the Corporation's off-balance sheet program activities.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Management

     Interest  Rate Risk.  Farmer Mac is  subject to  interest  rate risk on all
assets held for investment  because of possible  timing  differences in the cash
flows of the assets and related  liabilities.  This risk is primarily related to
loans held and on-balance sheet Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities because of the
ability of borrowers to prepay their mortgages before the scheduled  maturities,
thereby  increasing the risk of asset and liability cash flow  mismatches.  Cash
flow mismatches in a changing  interest rate environment can reduce the earnings
of the  Corporation  if assets repay sooner than expected and the resulting cash
flows must be reinvested in lower-yielding investments when Farmer Mac's funding
costs  cannot be  correspondingly  reduced,  or if assets repay more slowly than
expected and the associated debt must be replaced by higher-cost debt.

     Yield maintenance  provisions and other prepayment  penalties  contained in
many agricultural  mortgage loans reduce, but do not eliminate,  this prepayment
risk,  particularly in the case of a defaulted loan where yield  maintenance may
not be  collected.  Those  provisions  require  borrowers to make an  additional
payment when they prepay their loans,  so that, when reinvested with the prepaid
principal, yield maintenance payments generate substantially the same cash flows
that would have been generated had the loan not prepaid. Those provisions create
a disincentive  to prepayment and  compensate the  Corporation  for its interest
rate  risks  to a  large  degree.  As of  March  31,  2004,  58  percent  of the
outstanding  balance of all loans  held and loans  underlying  on-balance  sheet
Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities (including 92 percent of all loans with fixed
interest  rates)  were  covered  by  yield  maintenance   provisions  and  other
prepayment  penalties.  Of the Farmer Mac I new and current  loans  purchased in
first  quarter  2004,  12  percent  had yield  maintenance  or  another  form of
prepayment  protection.  None of the USDA-guaranteed  portions underlying Farmer
Mac II Guaranteed Securities had yield maintenance provisions.

     Taking  into  consideration  the  prepayment  provisions  and  the  default
probabilities  associated with its mortgage  assets,  Farmer Mac uses prepayment
models to project and value cash flows  associated  with these  assets.  Because
borrowers'  behavior in various interest rate environments may change over time,
Farmer Mac periodically  evaluates the effectiveness of these models compared to
actual prepayment  experience and adjusts and refines the models as necessary to
improve the precision of subsequent  prepayment forecasts.  In addition,  Farmer
Mac consults with independent prepayment experts as part of the model evaluation
process.

     The goal of Farmer Mac's  interest  rate risk  management  is to create and
maintain a portfolio that generates  stable  earnings and value across a variety
of interest  rate  environments.  Farmer  Mac's  primary  strategy  for managing
interest rate risk is to fund asset purchases with liabilities that have similar
durations  so that they will  perform  similarly as interest  rates  change.  To
achieve  this match,  Farmer Mac issues  discount  notes and both  callable  and
non-callable  medium-term  notes  across a spectrum  of  maturities.  Farmer Mac
issues callable debt to offset the prepayment risk associated with some mortgage
assets.  By  using a blend of  liabilities  that  includes  callable  debt,  the
interest rate  sensitivities  of the liabilities tend to increase or decrease as
interest  rates  change in a manner  similar  to changes  in the  interest  rate
sensitivities of the assets. Farmer Mac also uses financial derivatives to alter
the  duration of its assets and  liabilities  to better  match their  durations,
thereby reducing overall interest rate sensitivity.

     Farmer Mac's $336.2  million of cash and cash  equivalents  as of March 31,
2004 mature within three months and are match-funded  with discount notes having
similar maturities.  Investment  securities of $1.1 billion as of March 31, 2004
consist of $792.0 million (72 percent) of floating rate securities that all have
rates that adjust within one year.  These floating rate  investments  are funded
using:

     o    a series of discount note issuances in which each successive  discount
          note is issued  and  matures on or about the  corresponding  repricing
          date of the related investment;
     o    floating-rate  notes  having  similar  rate  reset  provisions  as the
          related investment; or
     o    fixed-rate  notes  swapped to  floating  rates  having  similar  reset
          provisions as the related investment.

     Farmer Mac is also subject to interest rate risk on loans,  including loans
that Farmer Mac has committed to acquire (other than through LTSPCs) but has not
yet purchased.  When Farmer Mac commits to purchase such loans, it is exposed to
interest  rate risk  between the time it commits to  purchase  the loans and the
time it either:

     o    sells Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities backed by the loans; or
     o    issues  debt to retain the loans in its  portfolio  (although  issuing
          debt to fund  the  loans  as  investments  does  not  fully  eliminate
          interest rate risk due to the possible timing  differences in the cash
          flows of the assets and related liabilities, as discussed above).

Farmer Mac manages the interest rate risk related to such loans, and any related
Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities or debt  issuance,  through the use of forward
sale   contracts   on  the  debt  and   mortgage-backed   securities   of  other
government-sponsored  enterprises and futures contracts  involving U.S. Treasury
securities.  Farmer Mac uses  forward  sale  contracts  on  government-sponsored
enterprise  securities  to reduce its interest  rate exposure to changes in both
Treasury  rates and  spreads  on Farmer  Mac debt and  Farmer  Mac I  Guaranteed
Securities.

      Since interest rate sensitivity may change with the passage of time and as
interest rates change, Farmer Mac assesses this exposure on a regular basis and
rebalances its portfolio of assets and liabilities as necessary by:

     o    purchasing mortgage assets in the ordinary course of business;
     o    refunding existing liabilities; or
     o    using derivatives to alter the  characteristics  of existing assets or
          liabilities.

     The most  strenuous  measure of the long-term  interest rate risk of Farmer
Mac's current portfolio is the sensitivity of its Market Value of Equity ("MVE")
to yield curve shocks. MVE represents the present value of all future cash flows
from on- and off-balance  sheet assets,  liabilities and financial  derivatives,
discounted  at  current  interest  rates and  spreads.  The  following  schedule
summarizes the results of Farmer Mac's MVE sensitivity  analysis as of March 31,
2004 and December 31, 2003 to an immediate and  instantaneous  parallel shift in
the yield curve.

</TABLE>

     During first quarter 2004,  Farmer Mac maintained a relatively low level of
interest  rate  sensitivity  through  ongoing  asset  and  liability  management
activities.  As of March 31, 2004, a uniform or "parallel" increase of 100 basis
points would have increased  NII, a shorter-term  measure of interest rate risk,
by 2.8  percent,  while a  parallel  decrease  of 100 basis  points  would  have
decreased NII by 4.3 percent.  Farmer Mac also measures the  sensitivity of both
MVE and  NII to a  variety  of  non-parallel  interest  rate  shocks,  including
flattening and steepening yield curve scenarios.  As of March 31, 2004, both MVE
and NII showed  similar  sensitivity to  non-parallel  shocks as to the parallel
shocks.  As of March 31, 2004,  Farmer Mac's  effective  duration  gap,  another
standard measure of interest rate risk, was minus 0.5 months,  compared to minus
0.1 months as of December 31, 2003. The  sensitivity of Farmer Mac's MVE and NII
to both parallel and  non-parallel  interest rate shocks,  and its duration gap,
are indicators of the  effectiveness of the  Corporation's  approach to managing
its interest rate risk exposures.

     The economic  effects of financial  derivatives,  including  interest  rate
swaps,  are  included in the MVE,  NII and  duration  gap  analyses.  Farmer Mac
generally  enters into various  interest rate swaps to reduce interest rate risk
as follows:

     o    "floating-to-fixed  interest  rate swaps" in which it pays fixed rates
          of  interest  to,  and  receives  floating  rates  of  interest  from,
          counterparties;  these swaps adjust the  characteristics of short-term
          debt to match more closely the cash flow and duration  characteristics
          of longer-term reset and fixed-rate mortgages and other assets and may
          provide  an  overall  lower  effective  cost of  borrowing  than would
          otherwise be available in the conventional debt market;
     o    "fixed-to-floating  interest  rate swaps" in which it  receives  fixed
          rates of  interest  from,  and pays  floating  rates of  interest  to,
          counterparties;  these swaps adjust the  characteristics  of long-term
          debt to match more closely the cash flow and duration  characteristics
          of short-term assets; and
     o    "basis swaps" in which it pays variable rates of interest based on one
          index to, and  receives  variable  rates of interest  based on another
          index from, counterparties; these swaps alter interest rate indices of
          liabilities to match those of assets, and vice versa.

As of March 31, 2004,  Farmer Mac had $1.5 billion  combined  notional amount of
interest  rate swaps with terms  ranging from 1 to 15 years.  Of those  interest
rate swaps,  $663.7  million were  floating-to-fixed  rate  interest rate swaps,
$576.4 million were basis swaps, $240.0 million were fixed-to-floating  interest
rate swaps, and $25 million fell under the category of other swaps.

     Farmer Mac uses financial  derivatives as an end-user for hedging purposes,
not for trading or speculative  purposes.  When financial  derivatives  meet the
specific  hedge  criteria  under SFAS 133, they are accounted for as either fair
value  hedges or cash flow  hedges.  Financial  derivatives  that do not satisfy
those hedge  criteria  are not  accounted  for as hedges and changes in the fair
value of those financial derivatives are reported as a gain or loss on financial
derivatives and trading assets in the consolidated statements of operations. All
of Farmer Mac's financial  derivative  transactions are conducted under standard
collateralized  agreements that limit Farmer Mac's potential  credit exposure to
any counterparty.  As of March 31, 2004, Farmer Mac had no uncollateralized  net
exposure to any counterparty.

     Credit Risk.  Farmer Mac's  primary  exposure to credit risk is the risk of
loss  resulting  from the  inability of  borrowers  to repay their  mortgages in
conjunction  with a deficiency  in the value of the  collateral  relative to the
amount  outstanding on the mortgage and the costs of liquidation.  Farmer Mac is
exposed to credit risk on:

     o    loans held for investment;
     o    loans underlying pre-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities;
     o    loans underlying  post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities or
          LTSPCs; and
     o    USDA-guaranteed   portions   underlying   Farmer  Mac  II   Guaranteed
          Securities.

     For loans underlying pre-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities,  ten
percent  first-loss  subordinated  interests  mitigate  Farmer Mac's credit risk
exposure.  Before  Farmer Mac incurs a credit loss,  full recourse must first be
taken  against  the   subordinated   interest.   The  1996  Act  eliminated  the
subordinated interest requirement. As a result, Farmer Mac generally assumes 100
percent of the credit  risk on loans held for  investment  and loans  underlying
post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs. Farmer Mac's credit
exposure on USDA-guaranteed  portions is covered by the full faith and credit of
the United States.  Farmer Mac believes it has little or no credit risk exposure
to loans underlying  pre-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities because of
the subordinated interests,  or to USDA-guaranteed  portions because of the USDA
guarantee.  The outstanding principal balance of loans held and loans underlying
Farmer  Mac  Guaranteed  Securities  (including  AgVantage  bonds)  or LTSPCs is
summarized in the table below.

     For  several  years,  Farmer  Mac  has  conducted  guarantee  fee  adequacy
analyses,  using stress-test models developed internally and with the assistance
of outside  experts.  These  analyses  have taken into  account  the diverse and
dissimilar  characteristics of the various asset categories for which Farmer Mac
manages its risk exposures,  and have evolved as the mix and character of assets
under management has shifted with growth in the business and the addition of new
asset  categories.  Based on current  information,  Farmer Mac believes that its
guarantee fee is adequate compensation for the credit risk that it assumes.

     Farmer  Mac  has  established  underwriting,  appraisal  and  documentation
standards  for  agricultural  mortgage  loans to mitigate  the risk of loss from
borrower   defaults  and  to  provide   guidance   concerning  the   management,
administration  and conduct of underwriting and appraisals to all  participating
sellers and potential sellers in its programs. These standards were developed on
the basis of industry norms for agricultural  mortgage loans and are designed to
assess  the  creditworthiness  of the  borrower,  as  well as the  value  of the
collateral   securing   the  loan.   Farmer   Mac   requires   sellers  to  make
representations  and warranties  regarding the  conformity of eligible  mortgage
loans to these  standards,  the accuracy of loan data provided to Farmer Mac and
other requirements  related to the loans.  Sellers are responsible to Farmer Mac
for breaches of those  representations  and  warranties  that result in economic
losses  to the  Corporation.  Pursuant  to  contracts  with  Farmer  Mac  and in
consideration for underwriting and servicing fees, Farmer  Mac-approved  central
servicers  underwrite  mortgage  loans for Farmer Mac in  accordance  with those
standards and other  requirements,  and service  those loans in accordance  with
Farmer Mac  requirements.  Central  servicers are  responsible to Farmer Mac for
serious errors in the underwriting and servicing of those mortgage loans.

     Farmer Mac I credit  underwriting  standards require that the loan-to-value
("LTV") ratio for any loan not exceed 70 percent,  except that a loan secured by
a livestock  facility and supported by a contract with an  integrator  (e.g.,  a
food processing  company) may have an LTV ratio of up to 75 percent, a part-time
farm loan supported by private mortgage insurance may have an LTV ratio of up to
85 percent and a rural housing loan supported by private mortgage  insurance may
have an LTV ratio of up to 97  percent.  Farmer Mac also has a loan  product for
borrowers with high credit scores whose loans are secured by collateral with low
LTV  ratios.  For those  borrowers,  loan  processing  has been  simplified  and
documentation of the credit ratios described below is not necessary.

     In the  case  of  newly-originated  loans  that  are  not  part-time  farm,
facility, low-documentation or rural housing loans, borrowers on the loans must,
among other criteria set forth in Farmer Mac's underwriting standards, also meet
the following standard underwriting ratios on a pro forma basis (that is, giving
effect to the new loan):

     o    credit score of 660 or more;
     o    debt-to-asset ratio of 50 percent or less;
     o    cash flow debt service coverage ratio on the mortgaged property of not
          less than 1:1;
     o    total debt service coverage ratio, including farm and non-farm income,
          of not less than 1.25:1; and
     o    ratio of current assets to current liabilities of not less than 1:1.

     Farmer Mac's underwriting standards provide for acceptance of loans that do
not conform to one or more of the standard  underwriting  ratios, other than LTV
ratio, when those loans:

     o    exceed  minimum  requirements  for  one or  more  of the  underwriting
          standards to a degree that compensates for  noncompliance  with one or
          more other standards, referred to as compensating strengths; and
     o    are made to  producers of  particular  agricultural  commodities  in a
          segment  of  agriculture  in which  such  compensating  strengths  are
          typical of the financial condition of sound borrowers in that segment.

Farmer  Mac's use of  compensating  strengths is not intended to provide a basis
for waiving or lessening the requirement that eligible  mortgage loans under the
Farmer Mac I program be of consistently high quality. In fact, loans approved on
the  basis of  compensating  strengths  have not  demonstrated  a  significantly
different  rate of default than that of loans that were approved on the basis of
conformance  with all of the  standard  credit  ratios.  As of March 31, 2004, a
total of $1.7 billion (35.3  percent) of the  outstanding  balance of loans held
and loans underlying LTSPCs and post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities
were  approved  based upon  compensating  strengths.  During first quarter 2004,
$78.4 million (45.4  percent) of the loans  purchased or added under LTSPCs were
approved based upon compensating strengths.

     In the case of a seasoned loan, Farmer Mac considers sustained  performance
to be a reliable  alternative  indicator of a borrower's ability to pay the loan
according to its terms.  A seasoned  loan  generally  will be deemed an eligible
loan if:

     o    it  has  been   outstanding   for  at  least  five  years  and  has  a
          loan-to-value ratio of 60 percent or less;
     o    there  have  been no  payments  on the loan more than 30 days past due
          during the previous three years; and
     o    there have been no material restructurings or modifications for credit
          reasons during the previous five years.

     A seasoned loan that has been  outstanding  for more than one year but less
than five years must  substantially  comply with the underwriting  standards for
newly originated loans as of the date the loan was originated by the lender. The
loan must also have a payment  history  that shows no payment  more than 30 days
past due during the three-year period  immediately prior to the date the loan is
either  purchased  by  Farmer  Mac or made  subject  to an  LTSPC.  As with  the
secondary  market for residential  mortgages,  there is no requirement that each
loan's compliance with the underwriting  standards be re-evaluated  after Farmer
Mac accepts the loan into its program.

     The due  diligence  Farmer Mac  performs  before  purchasing,  guaranteeing
securities backed by, or committing to purchase, loans includes:

     o    evaluation of loan database information to determine conformity to the
          criteria described above;
     o    confirmation that loan file data conform to database information;
     o    validation of supporting credit information in the loan files; and
     o    review of loan collateral appraisals.

All of the foregoing are performed  through  methods that give due regard to the
size, age, leverage and nature of the collateral for the loans.

     In the case of rural  housing and  part-time  farm loans,  the borrower may
finance up to 97 percent and 85 percent, respectively, of the appraised value of
the  property  if the amount  above 80  percent  is covered by private  mortgage
insurance. For newly originated part-time farm loans, the borrower must generate
sufficient income from all sources to repay all creditors. A borrower's capacity
to repay debt obligations generally is determined by three tests:

     o    the borrower's credit score should be 660 or more;
     o    the borrower's monthly mortgage  payment-to-income  ratio should be 28
          percent or less; and
     o    the borrower's total monthly debt payment-to-income ratio should be 36
          percent or less.

     Farmer Mac's appraisal standards for newly originated loans require,  among
other things,  that the  appraisal  function be performed  independently  of the
credit  decision-making   process  and  conform  to  the  Uniform  Standards  of
Professional  Appraisal Practice  promulgated by the Appraisal  Standards Board.
Farmer Mac's appraisal  standards require the appraisal function to be conducted
or administered by an individual  meeting specific  qualification and competence
criteria and who:

     o    is not  associated,  except by the engagement for the appraisal,  with
          the credit  underwriters  making the loan  decision,  though  both the
          appraiser  and the credit  underwriter  may be directly or  indirectly
          employed by a common employer;
     o    receives no financial or professional benefit of any kind by virtue of
          the report content,  valuation or credit decision made or based on the
          appraisal product; and
     o    has no present or contemplated  future direct or indirect  interest in
          the appraised property.

The appraisal  standards also require uniform reporting of reliable and credible
opinions   of  the  market   value,   market  rent  and   property   net  income
characteristics of the mortgaged property and the relative market forces.

     Farmer Mac requires current  collateral  valuations in conformance with the
Uniform Standards of Professional  Appraisal Practice for newly originated loans
purchased  or placed  under a Farmer Mac I  Guaranteed  Security  or LTSPC.  For
seasoned loans, Farmer Mac obtains appraisal updates as considered  necessary by
its assessment of collateral risk determined in the due diligence process.

     Farmer Mac  maintains an allowance for losses to cover  estimated  probable
losses on loans held for  investment,  real  estate  owned and loans  underlying
post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities and LTSPCs in accordance  with
Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standard No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies
("SFAS 5") and Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 114, Accounting by
Creditors for Impairment of a Loan, as amended ("SFAS 114"). The methodology for
determining  the allowance for losses is the same for loans held for  investment
and loans underlying post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs
because Farmer Mac believes the ultimate credit risk is substantially  the same,
i.e.,  the  underlying  agricultural  mortgage  loans  all meet the same  credit
underwriting  and  appraisal  standards.  For accepting the credit risk on loans
underlying post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities and LTSPCs,  Farmer
Mac receives guarantee fees and commitment fees,  respectively.  For loans held,
Farmer Mac receives interest income that includes a component that correlates to
its guarantee fee, which Farmer Mac views as compensation  for accepting  credit
risk.

     No  allowance  for losses has been made for loans  underlying  Farmer Mac I
Guaranteed  Securities  issued prior to the 1996 Act or Farmer Mac II Guaranteed
Securities.  Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities issued prior to the 1996 Act are
supported by unguaranteed first-loss subordinated interests,  which are expected
to exceed the estimated credit losses on those loans.  USDA-guaranteed  portions
collateralizing  Farmer Mac II Guaranteed  Securities are obligations  backed by
the full  faith  and  credit  of the  United  States.  To date,  Farmer  Mac has
experienced  no credit  losses  on any  pre-1996  Act  Farmer  Mac I  Guaranteed
Securities or on any Farmer Mac II Guaranteed  Securities and does not expect to
incur any such losses in the future.

     Farmer Mac's  allowance  for losses is presented in four  components on its
consolidated balance sheet:

     o    an "Allowance for loan losses" on loans held for investment;
     o    a valuation  allowance on real estate owned,  which is included in the
          balance sheet under "Real estate owned, net of valuation allowance";
     o    an allowance for losses on loans underlying post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I
          Guaranteed  Securities  and  LTSPCs  entered  into or  modified  after
          January 1, 2003,  which is included in the balance  sheet as a portion
          of the amount reported as "Guarantee and commitment obligation"; and
     o    an allowance for losses on loans underlying post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I
          Guaranteed  Securities  and  LTSPCs  entered  into prior to January 1,
          2003,  which is  included  in the balance  sheet  under  "Reserve  for
          losses."

     Farmer Mac's  provision  for losses is presented in two  components  on its
consolidated statement of operations:

     o    a "Provision for loan losses,"  which  represents  estimated  probable
          losses on Farmer Mac's loans held for investment; and
     o    a "Provision for losses," which represents  estimated  probable losses
          on loans underlying  post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities
          and LTSPCs and real estate owned.

     Farmer Mac estimates probable losses using a systematic process that begins
with  management's  evaluation  of the  results  of its  proprietary  loan  pool
simulation  and  guarantee  fee  model  (the  "Model").  The  Model  draws  upon
historical  information from a data set of agricultural  mortgage loans recorded
over a longer period of time than Farmer Mac's own experience to date,  screened
to include  only those  loans with  credit  characteristics  similar to those on
which Farmer Mac has assumed credit risk. The results generated by the Model are
modified by the  application of management's  judgment,  as required to take key
factors into account, including:

     o    economic conditions;
     o    geographic and agricultural  commodity  concentrations in Farmer Mac's
          portfolio;
     o    the credit profile of Farmer Mac's portfolio;
     o    delinquency trends of Farmer Mac's portfolio;
     o    Farmer  Mac's  experience  in the  management  and sale of real estate
          owned; and
     o    historical   charge-off  and  recovery   activities  of  Farmer  Mac's
          portfolio.

     Management  believes that its use of this  methodology  produces a reliable
estimate of total probable  losses,  as of the balance sheet date, for all loans
included in Farmer Mac's  portfolio,  including loans held for investment,  real
estate  owned  and  loans  underlying  post-1996  Act  Farmer  Mac I  Guaranteed
Securities and LTSPCs.

     Farmer Mac's  methodology  for  determining  its  allowance for losses will
migrate  over time  away from the  Model,  to become  based on Farmer  Mac's own
historical portfolio loss experience.  Until that time, Farmer Mac will continue
to use the results from the Model,  augmented by the application of management's
judgment, to determine its allowance for losses.

     In  addition,   Farmer  Mac   specifically   analyzes   its   portfolio  of
non-performing  assets  (loans  90  days  or  more  past  due,  in  foreclosure,
restructured,  in  bankruptcy,  including  loans  performing  under either their
original loan terms or a court-approved  bankruptcy plan, and real estate owned)
for impairment on a loan-by-loan  basis. This analysis measures impairment based
on the fair value of the underlying collateral for each individual loan relative
to the total amount due, including  principal,  interest and advances under SFAS
114.  In the event  that the  updated  appraisal  or  management's  estimate  of
discounted  collateral  value does not support the total amount due,  Farmer Mac
specifically  allocates an allowance for the loan for the difference between the
recorded  investment and its fair value,  less estimated  costs to liquidate the
collateral.

     Management  believes that the general  allowance,  which is the  difference
between the total allowance for losses (generated  through use of the Model) and
the specific  allowances,  adequately covers any probable losses inherent in the
portfolio of performing loans under SFAS 5.

     Farmer  Mac  believes  that the  methodology  described  above  produces  a
reliable  estimate  of the total  probable  losses  inherent  in the  Farmer Mac
portfolio. The Model:

     o    uses  historical   agricultural   real  estate  loan  origination  and
          servicing  data that reflect  varied  economic  conditions  and stress
          levels in the agricultural sector;
     o    contains  features that allow variations for changes in loan portfolio
          characteristics  to make the data set  representative  of Farmer Mac's
          portfolio and credit underwriting standards; and
     o    considers  the effects of the ageing of the loan  portfolio  along the
          expected loss curves  associated  with individual  cohort  origination
          years,  including the segments that are entering into or coming out of
          their peak default years.

     Farmer Mac  analyzes  various  iterations  of the Model data and  considers
various  configurations of loan types,  terms,  economic conditions and borrower
eligibility  criteria to generate a distribution of loss exposures over time for
all loans in the  portfolio,  all to evaluate its overall  allowance for losses,
and back tests the results to validate  the Model.  Such tests use prior  period
data  to  project  losses  expected  in  a  current  period  and  compare  those
projections to actual losses incurred during the current period.

     The allowance for losses is increased through periodic  provisions for loan
losses that are charged  against net interest  income and  provisions for losses
charged to operating  expense and reduced by charge-offs for actual losses,  net
of recoveries.  The  establishment of and periodic  adjustments to the valuation
allowance for real estate owned are charged  against  income as a portion of the
provision for losses charged to operating expense.  Charge-offs represent losses
on the outstanding  principal balance,  any interest payments previously accrued
or advanced and expected costs of  liquidation.  Gains and losses on the sale of
real estate  owned are recorded in income  based on the  difference  between the
recorded investment at the time of sale and liquidation proceeds.

Mac's allowance for losses for the three months ended March 31, 2004 and 2003:

     Farmer Mac's total  provision for losses was $1.6 million for first quarter
2004,  compared to $2.2 million for first  quarter  2003.  During first  quarter
2004,  Farmer Mac charged off $1.5 million in losses  against the  allowance for
losses and had $37,000 in  recoveries.  During first  quarter  2003,  Farmer Mac
charged  off $1.3  million  in losses  against  the  allowance  for  losses  and
recovered $0.2 million from previously  charged off losses,  for net charge-offs
of $1.1  million.  The net  charge-offs  for first quarter 2004 and 2003 did not
include  previously  accrued  or  advanced  interest  on loans and  Farmer Mac I
Guaranteed  Securities.  As of March 31, 2004, Farmer Mac's allowance for losses
totaled $22.2 million,  or 45 basis points of the outstanding  principal balance
of loans  held and  loans  underlying  post-1996  Act  Farmer  Mac I  Guaranteed
Securities  and  LTSPCs,  compared  to $22.1  million  (44 basis  points)  as of
December 31, 2003.

     As of March 31,  2004,  Farmer  Mac's 90-day  delinquencies  totaled  $57.4
million and represented 1.17 percent of the principal  balance of all loans held
and loans  underlying  post-1996  Act Farmer  Mac I  Guaranteed  Securities  and
LTSPCs,  compared to $76.2  million  (1.58  percent) as of March 31, 2003. As of
March 31, 2004,  Farmer  Mac's  non-performing  assets  (which  includes  90-day
delinquencies,  loans  performing  under either their  original  loan terms or a
court-approved bankruptcy plan, and real estate owned) totaled $91.3 million and
represented  1.86 percent of the  principal  balance of all loans held and loans
underlying post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs, compared
to $94.8  million  (1.97  percent)  as of March 31,  2003.  Loans that have been
restructured  after  delinquency were  insignificant and are included within the
reported 90-day delinquency and non-performing  asset disclosures.  From quarter
to quarter,  Farmer Mac anticipates that 90-day delinquencies and non-performing
assets will  fluctuate,  both in dollars and as a percentage of the  outstanding
portfolio,  with higher levels likely at the end of the first and third quarters
of each year corresponding to the semi-annual (January 1st and July 1st) payment
characteristics of most Farmer Mac I loans.

</TABLE>


     As of March 31, 2004,  approximately  $1.6 billion (32.9 percent) of Farmer
Mac's  outstanding  loans held and loans  underlying  post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I
Guaranteed  Securities  and LTSPCs  were in their peak  delinquency  and default
years  (approximately  years three through five after  origination)  compared to
$1.8 billion (37.4  percent) of such loans as of March 31, 2003. The Model takes
the portfolio age distribution and maturation into  consideration.  Accordingly,
those trends did not cause  management to alter the Model's  projection  for the
provisions for losses.

     As of March 31, 2004, Farmer Mac analyzed the following three categories of
assets for impairment, based on the fair vale of the underlying collateral:

     o    $91.3 million of non-performing assets;

     o    $29.8 million of loans for which Farmer Mac has adjusted the timing of
          borrowers'  payment  schedules  within the past three years, but still
          expects  to  collect  all  amounts  due  and  has  not  made  economic
          concessions; and

     o    $59.1 million of performing loans that have previously been delinquent
          or are  secured by real  estate that  produces  commodities  currently
          under stress.

Those  individual  assessments  covered  a total of  $180.2  million  of  assets
measured  for  impairment  against  updated  appraised  values,   other  updated
collateral  valuations or  discounted  values.  Of the $180.2  million of assets
analyzed, $154.0 million were adequately  collateralized.  For the $26.2 million
that  were  not  adequately  collateralized,  individual  collateral  shortfalls
totaled $4.4 million.  Accordingly,  Farmer Mac allocated specific allowances of
$4.4 million to those  under-collateralized  assets as of March 31, 2004.  As of
March   31,   2004,   after   the   allocation   of   specific   allowances   to
under-collateralized  loans,  Farmer Mac had additional  non-specific or general
allowances of $17.8  million,  bringing the total  allowance for losses to $22.2
million.

     The following table summarizes  Farmer Mac's assets  specifically  reviewed
for impairment and allowance for losses:

     Original LTV ratios  (calculated by dividing the loan principal  balance at
the time of guarantee, purchase or commitment by the appraised value at the date
of loan origination or, when available,  updated  appraised value at the time of
guarantee,  purchase or commitment) are one of many factors Farmer Mac considers
in evaluating  loss  severity.  Other factors  include,  but are not limited to,
other  underwriting  standards,  commodity  and farming  forecasts  and regional
economic and agricultural conditions.  Loans in the Farmer Mac I program are all
first  mortgage  agricultural  real  estate  loans.  Accordingly,  Farmer  Mac's
exposure on a loan is limited to the difference between the total of the accrued
interest,  advances  and  principal  balance  of a loan  and  the  value  of the
property.  Measurement  of that excess or  shortfall is the best  predictor  and
determinant of loss compared to other measures that evaluate the efficiency of a
particular farm operator.

     LTV ratios  depend upon the market value of a property  with due regard for
its income-producing potential. As required by Farmer Mac's collateral valuation
standards, an appraisal of agricultural real estate must include analysis of the
income  producing  capability of the property and address the income estimate in
the market  analysis.  Debt service ratios depend upon farm operator  efficiency
and leverage,  which can vary widely within a geographic region,  commodity type
or an operator's business and farming skills.

     As of March 31, 2004, the weighted-average original LTV ratio for all loans
held and loans underlying  post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities and
LTSPCs  was 49  percent,  and the  weighted-average  original  LTV ratio for all
post-1996 Act non-performing assets was 54 percent.

      The following table summarizes the post-1996 Act non-performing assets by
original LTV ratio:

     An analysis  of Farmer  Mac's  historical  losses and  identified  specific
collateral  deficiencies  within the portfolio (by  origination  year) indicates
that  Farmer Mac has  experienced  peak loss  years as loans  have aged  between
approximately their third and fifth years subsequent to origination,  regardless
of the year the loans were added to the Farmer Mac's portfolio. As a consequence
of the combination of principal  amortization and collateral value appreciation,
there  are few  loans  in the  portfolio  originated  prior to 1996  with  known
collateral deficiencies.  While Farmer Mac expects that there will be loans that
have aged  past  their  fifth  year that will  become  delinquent  and  possibly
default, Farmer Mac does not anticipate significant losses on such loans.

     Analysis of portfolio performance by commodity  distribution indicates that
losses and  collateral  deficiencies  have been and are  expected to remain less
prevalent in the loans secured by real estate producing agricultural commodities
that receive significant government support (such as cotton, soybeans, wheat and
corn)  and more  prevalent  in those  that do not  receive  such  support.  This
analysis is consistent with corresponding  commodity  analysis,  which indicates
that Farmer Mac has experienced  higher loss and collateral  deficiency rates in
its loans  classified  as permanent  plantings.  Loans  classified  as permanent
plantings do not receive  significant  government support and are therefore more
susceptible to adverse  commodity-specific  economic trends. Further, as adverse
economic conditions persist for a particular commodity that requires a long-term
improvement on the land, such as permanent plantings, the prospective sale value
of  the  land  is  likely  to  decrease   and  the  related   loans  may  become
under-collateralized.  Farmer  Mac  anticipates  that  one  or  more  particular
commodity  groups will be under  economic  pressure at any one time and actively
manages its portfolio to mitigate  concentration  risks while preserving  Farmer
Mac's ability to meet the financing needs of all commodity groups.

     Analysis of portfolio  performance  by  geographic  distribution  indicates
that, for particular  commodity  groups,  certain  geographic areas offer better
growing  conditions than others and  consequently  produce more successful farms
relative to the commodity group. This consequence  tends to be consistent,  even
though those farms are exposed to the economic  cycles of the  commodity  group.
Other geographic  areas offer suitable  growing  conditions for a wider range of
commodities and consequently  produce more versatile farms that have the ability
to vary crop  plantings  among  commodity  groups in  accordance  with  expected
economic returns.

     Farmer Mac's  methodologies  for pricing its guarantee and commitment fees,
managing credit risks and providing adequate  allowances for losses consider all
of the foregoing factors and information.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

     Farmer Mac has  sufficient  liquidity and capital  resources to support its
operations  for the next twelve  months and has a  contingency  funding  plan to
handle unanticipated disruptions in its access to the capital markets.

     Debt Issuance.  Section 8.6(e) of Farmer Mac's statutory charter (12 U.S.C.
ss.  2279aa-6(e))  authorizes  Farmer Mac to issue debt  obligations to purchase
eligible  mortgage  loans and Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities and to maintain
reasonable amounts for business operations, including adequate liquidity. Farmer
Mac funds its  program  operations  primarily  by issuing  debt  obligations  of
various maturities in the public capital markets.  Farmer Mac's debt obligations
consist  of  discount  notes  and  medium-term  notes  issued  to  obtain  funds
principally  to cover the costs of purchasing  and holding loans and  securities
(including  Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities).  Farmer Mac also issues discount
notes and medium-term  notes to obtain funds for investments,  transaction costs
and guarantee payments.  The Corporation's  discount notes and medium-term notes
are  obligations  of Farmer Mac only, are not rated by any rating agency and the
interest and principal thereon are not guaranteed by and do not constitute debts
or obligations of FCA or the United States or any agency or  instrumentality  of
the United  States other than Farmer Mac.  Farmer Mac is an  institution  of the
Farm Credit  System,  but is not liable for any debt or  obligation of any other
institution of the Farm Credit System. Likewise,  neither the Farm Credit System
nor any other individual institution of the Farm Credit System is liable for any
debt or  obligation  of Farmer Mac.  Income on Farmer Mac's  discount  notes and
medium-term notes has no tax exemption under federal law from federal,  state or
local taxation.

     Farmer Mac's board of directors has  authorized  the issuance of up to $5.0
billion of  discount  notes and  medium-term  notes (of which $3.6  billion  was
outstanding as of March 31, 2004), subject to periodic review of the adequacy of
that level relative to Farmer Mac's borrowing  requirements.  Farmer Mac invests
the proceeds of such issuances in loans,  Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities and
non-program  investment assets in accordance with guidelines  established by its
board of directors.

     Liquidity.  The  funding  and  liquidity  needs of  Farmer  Mac's  business
programs are driven by the purchase and  retention of eligible  loans and Farmer
Mac  Guaranteed  Securities,  the  maturities of Farmer Mac's discount notes and
medium-term notes and payment of principal and interest on Farmer Mac Guaranteed
Securities. Farmer Mac's primary sources of funds to meet these needs are:

     o    principal and interest  payments and ongoing  guarantee and commitment
          fees received on loans, Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs;
     o    principal and interest payments  received from investment  securities;
          and
     o    the issuance of discount notes and medium-term notes.

     Farmer Mac  projects  its  expected  cash flows from loans and  securities,
other earnings and the sale of assets and matches those with its  obligations to
retire  debt and pay  other  liabilities  as they come due.  Farmer  Mac  issues
discount  notes  and  medium-term  notes to meet the needs  associated  with its
business operations,  including liquidity,  and also to increase its presence in
the capital markets in order to enhance the liquidity and pricing  efficiency of
its discount notes and  medium-term  notes and Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities
transactions  and so improve the mortgage rates  available to farmers,  ranchers
and rural homeowners.

     Though Farmer Mac's mortgage  purchases do not currently  necessitate daily
debt issuance,  the Corporation  continued its strategy of using its non-program
investment  portfolio  (referred  to as Farmer  Mac's  liquidity  portfolio)  to
facilitate  increasing its ongoing  presence in the capital markets during 2004.
To meet investor  demand for daily presence in the capital  markets,  Farmer Mac
issues  discount  notes  in  maturities  principally  ranging  from  one  day to
approximately  90 days and invests  the  proceeds  not needed for program  asset
purchases in highly-rated  securities.  Investments are predominantly short-term
money market  securities  with  maturities  closely matched to the discount note
maturities and  floating-rate  securities with reset terms of less than one year
and closely matched to the maturity of the discount  notes.  The positive spread
earned from these investments enhances the net interest income Farmer Mac earns,
thereby improving the net yields at which Farmer Mac can purchase mortgages from
lenders who may pass that  benefit to  farmers,  ranchers  and rural  homeowners
through the Farmer Mac programs.  Subject to dollar amount, issuer concentration
and  credit  quality  limitations,  the  Corporation's  board of  directors  has
authorized non-program investments in:

     o    U.S. treasury obligations;
     o    agency and instrumentality obligations;
     o    repurchase agreements;
     o    commercial paper;
     o    guaranteed investment contracts;
     o    certificates of deposit;
     o    federal funds and bankers acceptances;
     o    securities and debt obligations of corporate and municipal issuers;
     o    asset-backed securities;
     o    corporate money market funds; and
     o    preferred stock of government-sponsored enterprises.

As of  March  31,  2004,  Farmer  Mac  was in  compliance  with  the  investment
authorizations set forth in its investment guidelines.

     As a result  of  Farmer  Mac's  regular  issuance  of  discount  notes  and
medium-term notes and its status as a federally chartered instrumentality of the
United  States,  Farmer  Mac has been  able to access  the  capital  markets  at
favorable rates. Farmer Mac has also used floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps,
combined with discount note issuances,  as a source of fixed-rate funding. While
the swap market may provide  favorable  fixed rates,  swap  transactions  expose
Farmer Mac to the risk of future  widening of its own  issuance  spreads  versus
corresponding  LIBOR rates. If the spreads on the Farmer Mac discount notes were
to  increase  relative to LIBOR,  Farmer Mac would be exposed to a  commensurate
reduction   on  its  net  interest   yield  on  the   notional   amount  of  its
floating-to-fixed  interest  rate  swaps and  other  LIBOR-based  floating  rate
assets.  Farmer Mac  compensates for this risk by pricing the required net yield
on program  asset  purchases to reflect the cost of  medium-term  notes  without
regard to the savings that may be achievable in the interest rate swap market.

     Farmer Mac  maintains a  liquidity  investment  portfolio  of cash and cash
equivalents  (including  commercial  paper and  other  short-term  money  market
instruments)  and  investment  securities  consisting  mostly of  floating  rate
securities  that reprice within one year,  which can be drawn upon for liquidity
needs.  As of March  31,  2004,  Farmer  Mac's  cash and  cash  equivalents  and
investment securities totaled $336.2 million and $1.1 billion,  respectively,  a
combined  36.6 percent of total assets.  For first  quarter  2004,  exclusive of
daily  overnight  discount  note  issuances  that were invested  overnight,  the
average discount note issuance term and re-funding  frequency was  approximately
84 days.

Other Matters

     In recent developments:

     o    the Committee on Agriculture of the U.S. House of Representatives  has
          announced its plan to hold a hearing for review of the  Corporation on
          June 2, 2004; and
     o    the FCA Board,  at a public  meeting held on April 22, 2004,  approved
          (pending 30 day Congressional review) proposed rules that would, among
          other  things,  require  Farmer  Mac to hold  sufficient  high-quality
          marketable  investments  to  provide  liquidity  adequate  to fund its
          maturing  obligations and operations for a minimum of 60 days, and set
          standards for the quality of those investments, with an effective date
          2 years after the final regulation is adopted.

Farmer Mac  currently has a 60-day  minimum  liquidity  policy and  conservative
investment policies, established and periodically reviewed by its Board. After a
preliminary  review of  details  received  from FCA on May 7,  2004,  Farmer Mac
believes that the proposed  regulations  would not be largely  inconsistent with
the  Corporation's  current  policies.  Farmer Mac  continues  to analyze  those
details and expects to provide FCA with comments on the proposal during a 90 day
public comment period following the anticipated mid-June 2004 publication of the
proposed regulations in the Federal Register.

     Always conscious of the importance of oversight and sound regulation in the
performance  of its mission for the farmers,  ranchers and rural  homeowners  of
America,  Farmer  Mac looks  forward to  participating  in the  hearing  and the
regulatory process.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

     Farmer Mac is exposed to market  risk  attributable  to changes in interest
rates.  Farmer Mac manages this market risk by entering  into various  financial
transactions, including financial derivatives, and by monitoring its exposure to
changes  in  interest  rates.  See  "Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of
Financial  Condition  and Results of  Operations--Quantitative  and  Qualitative
Disclosures  About  Market  Risk   Management--Interest   Rate  Risk"  for  more
information  about Farmer Mac's exposure to interest rate risk and strategies to
manage such risk. For information  regarding  Farmer Mac's use of and accounting
policies for financial derivatives,  see Note 1(c) to the condensed consolidated
financial  statements.  See  "Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition  and  Results of  Operations--Liquidity  and  Capital  Resources"  for
further information regarding Farmer Mac's debt issuance and liquidity risks.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures

     Farmer Mac maintains  disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed in the Corporation's  periodic filings
under the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"),  including this
report, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis. These
disclosure  controls and procedures include controls and procedures  designed to
ensure that  information  required to be  disclosed  under the  Exchange  Act is
accumulated and communicated to the  Corporation's  management on a timely basis
to allow decisions regarding required  disclosure.  Farmer Mac's Chief Executive
Officer and Chief  Financial  Officer have  evaluated the  effectiveness  of the
design and operation of the Corporation's disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined under Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of March 31,
2004. Based upon that evaluation, Farmer Mac's Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer have concluded that the Corporation's  disclosure controls and
procedures  are adequate and  effective.  For the quarter  ended March 31, 2004,
there were no significant changes in Farmer Mac's internal controls, or in other
factors that could materially  affect these controls,  subsequent to the date of
their  evaluation,  including any corrective  actions with regard to significant
deficiencies or material weaknesses.
