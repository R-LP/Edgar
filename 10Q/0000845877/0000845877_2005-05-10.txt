Item 1. Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

     The following interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
of  the  Federal   Agricultural   Mortgage  Corporation  ("Farmer  Mac"  or  the
"Corporation")  have been prepared  pursuant to the rules and regulations of the
Securities  and  Exchange  Commission.   These  interim  condensed  consolidated
financial  statements reflect all normal and recurring  adjustments that are, in
the  opinion  of  management,  necessary  to  present  a fair  statement  of the
financial  condition and the results of operations  and cash flows of Farmer Mac
for the interim periods presented.  Certain information and footnote disclosures
normally  included  in  annual  consolidated   financial  statements  have  been
condensed  or omitted as  permitted  by such rules and  regulations.  Management
believes  that the  disclosures  are  adequate to present  fairly the  condensed
consolidated  financial position,  condensed  consolidated results of operations
and  condensed  consolidated  cash  flows as of the  dates  and for the  periods
presented.  These interim condensed  consolidated financial statements should be
read in conjunction with the audited 2004 consolidated  financial  statements of
Farmer Mac included in the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year

(a)   Cash and Cash Equivalents

     Farmer Mac considers  highly liquid  investment  securities  with remaining
maturities  of  three  months  or  less  at the  time  of  purchase  to be  cash
equivalents. Changes in the balance of cash and cash equivalents are reported in
the condensed  consolidated  statements of cash flows.  The following table sets
forth information regarding certain cash and non-cash transactions for the three
months ended March 31, 2005 and 2004.

            (b) Allowance for Losses

     As of March 31, 2005,  Farmer Mac maintained a $16.3 million  allowance and
contingent  obligation  for probable  losses  ("allowance  for losses") to cover
estimated  probable losses on loans held for investment,  real estate owned, and
loans underlying  long-term standby purchase  commitments  ("LTSPCs") and Farmer
Mac I Guaranteed  Securities  issued after the Farm Credit  System Reform Act of
1996 (the "1996 Act") in  accordance  with  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting
Standards  No. 5,  Accounting  for  Contingencies  ("SFAS 5") and  Statement  of
Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 114, Accounting by Creditors for Impairment
of a Loan,  as  amended  ("SFAS  114").  The  methodology  for  determining  the
allowance  for  losses  is the same for  loans  held for  investment  and  loans
underlying  post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities and LTSPCs because
Farmer Mac believes the ultimate credit risk is  substantially  the same,  i.e.,
the underlying agricultural mortgage loans all meet the same credit underwriting
and appraisal standards.

     The allowance for losses is increased through periodic  provisions for loan
losses that are charged  against net interest  income and  provisions for losses
that are charged to operating  expense and is reduced by charge-offs  for actual
losses, net of recoveries. Negative provisions for loan losses or provisions for
losses are recorded in the event that the estimate of probable  losses as of the
end of a period is lower  than the  estimate  at the  beginning  of the  period.
Charge-offs  represent losses on the outstanding principal balance, any interest
payments previously accrued or advanced and expected costs of liquidation.

     The table below  summarizes  the  components of Farmer Mac's  allowance for
losses as of March 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004.

</TABLE>

     No  allowance  for losses has been made for loans  underlying  Farmer Mac I
Guaranteed  Securities  issued prior to the 1996 Act or securities  issued under
the Farmer Mac II program ("Farmer Mac II Guaranteed Securities").  Farmer Mac I
Guaranteed Securities issued prior to the 1996 Act are supported by unguaranteed
first loss  subordinated  interests,  which are expected to exceed the estimated
credit losses on those loans. The guaranteed portions collateralizing Farmer Mac
II Guaranteed  Securities  are  guaranteed  by the United  States  Department of
Agriculture  ("USDA").  Each USDA guarantee is an obligation  backed by the full
faith and credit of the United States.  To date,  Farmer Mac has  experienced no
credit  losses on any pre-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities or on any
Farmer Mac II Guaranteed Securities and does not expect to incur any such losses
in the future.

Mac's allowance for losses for the three months ended March 31, 2005 and 2004:

     As of March 31, 2005,  Farmer Mac analyzed  $94.1 million of its assets for
collateral shortfalls against updated appraised values, other updated collateral
valuations or discounted values. Of the $94.1 million of assets analyzed,  $81.7
million were  adequately  collateralized.  For the $12.4  million of assets that
were not adequately  collateralized,  individual  collateral  shortfalls totaled
$0.9  million.  Accordingly,  Farmer Mac allocated  specific  allowances of $0.9
million to those  under-collateralized  assets as of March 31, 2005. As of March
31, 2005,  after the allocation of specific  allowances to  under-collateralized
loans,  Farmer Mac had additional  non-specific  or general  allowances of $15.4
million, bringing the total allowance for losses to $16.3 million.

     The balance of impaired  assets,  both on- and off-balance  sheet,  and the
related  allowance  specifically  allocated to those impaired assets as of March
31, 2005 and December 31, 2004 are summarized in the following table:

            (c) Financial Derivatives

     Farmer Mac enters into  financial  derivative  transactions  principally to
protect against risk from the effects of market price or interest rate movements
on the value of certain assets and future cash flows or debt  issuance,  not for
trading or  speculative  purposes.  Farmer Mac enters  into  interest  rate swap
contracts  principally to adjust the  characteristics  of its short-term debt to
match more closely the cash flow and duration characteristics of its longer-term
mortgage  and  other  assets,  and also to  adjust  the  characteristics  of its
long-term debt to match more closely the cash flow and duration  characteristics
of  its  short-term   assets,   thereby  reducing   interest  rate  risk.  These
transactions  also may provide an overall lower effective cost of borrowing than
would otherwise be available in the conventional debt market.

     All financial  derivatives  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value
as  a  freestanding  asset  or  liability.   Financial  derivatives  in  hedging
relationships  that mitigate exposure to changes in the fair value of assets are
considered  fair value hedges.  Financial  derivatives in hedging  relationships
that mitigate the exposure to the  variability in expected  future cash flows or
other  forecasted  transactions  are  considered  cash  flow  hedges.  Financial
derivatives  that do not satisfy the hedging  criteria of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative  Instruments and Hedging
Activities, as amended ("SFAS 133") are not accounted for as hedges, and changes
in the fair  values of those  financial  derivatives  are  reported  as gains or
losses on financial derivatives and trading assets in the condensed consolidated
statements of operations.

     The  following  table  summarizes   information  related  to  Farmer  Mac's
financial derivatives as of March 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004:

</TABLE>

     As of March 31, 2005,  Farmer Mac had  approximately  $22.2  million of net
after-tax  unrealized  losses on cash flow hedges included in accumulated  other
comprehensive income/(loss). These amounts will be reclassified into earnings in
the same  period or  periods  during  which the hedged  forecasted  transactions
(either  the payment of interest  or the  issuance  of  discount  notes)  affect
earnings  or  immediately  when it becomes  probable  that the  original  hedged
forecasted  transaction  will not occur  within  two  months  of the  originally
specified  date.  Over the next twelve  months,  Farmer Mac estimates  that $4.1
million of the amount  currently  reported in  accumulated  other  comprehensive
income/(loss)  will be reclassified  into earnings.  For the quarter ended March
31, 2005,  any  ineffectiveness  related to Farmer Mac's  designated  hedges was
insignificant.

            (d) Earnings Per Common Share

     Basic earnings per common share are based on the weighted-average number of
common shares  outstanding.  Diluted  earnings per common share are based on the
weighted-average  number of common  shares  outstanding  adjusted to include all
potentially  dilutive common stock options.  The following  schedule  reconciles
basic and diluted  earnings per common share  ("EPS") for the three months ended
March 31, 2005 and 2004:

     During first quarter 2005,  Farmer Mac  repurchased  291,454  shares of its
Class C  Non-Voting  Common  Stock,  at an  average  price of $20.35  per share,
pursuant to the  Corporation's  previously  announced stock repurchase  program.
These  repurchases  reduced  the  Corporation's  capital by  approximately  $5.9
million.

            (e) Stock-Based Compensation

     Farmer Mac accounts for its stock-based  employee  compensation plans using
the intrinsic value method of accounting for employee stock options  pursuant to
Accounting  Principles  Board  Opinion No. 25,  Accounting  for Stock  Issued to
Employees  ("APB  25"),  and  has  adopted  the  disclosure-only  provisions  of
Statement of Financial  Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation,  as amended ("SFAS 123"). Accordingly, no compensation expense was
recognized in first quarter 2005 or first quarter 2004 for employee stock option
plans.  Had Farmer Mac elected to use the fair value  method of  accounting  for
employee stock options,  there would have been no effect on net income available
to common  stockholders  and earnings per share for the three months ended March
31, 2005 and 2004, as no stock options were granted during either period.

            (f) Reclassifications

      Certain reclassifications of prior period information were made to conform
to the current period presentation.

            (g) New Accounting Standards

     In December 2003, the American  Institute of Certified  Public  Accountants
issued  Statement  of  Position  03-3,  Accounting  for  Certain  Loans  or Debt
Securities  Acquired in a Transfer ("SOP 03-3").  SOP 03-3 addresses  accounting
for  differences  between  contractual  cash flows and cash flows expected to be
collected  from an investor's  initial  investment  in loans or debt  securities
acquired in a transfer if those differences are attributable,  at least in part,
to credit quality.  Specifically, SOP 03-3 limits the yield that may be accreted
and prohibits the  "carry-over" of a valuation  allowance for all impaired loans
that are  within  the  scope  of SOP  03-3.  On  January  1,  2005,  Farmer  Mac
prospectively  adopted  SOP 03-3 with no  material  impact  on its  consolidated
financial statements.

     In March 2004, the Emerging  Issues Task Force ("EITF")  amended EITF 03-1,
The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary  Impairment, to introduce a three-step model
to: (1) determine  whether an investment is impaired;  (2) evaluate  whether the
impairment  is  other-than-temporary;  and (3) account for  other-than-temporary
impairments. In part, this amendment requires companies to apply qualitative and
quantitative  measures  to  determine  whether a decline  in the fair value of a
security is  other-than-temporary.  The guidance in EITF 03-1 is  effective  for
reporting  periods  beginning after June 15, 2004, with the exception of certain
sections,  which have been deferred.  Farmer Mac is evaluating the impact of the
amendment and will adopt it when it is effective in full. In the interim, Farmer
Mac continues to apply earlier authoritative accounting guidance, primarily SFAS
115 and EITF 99-20,  Recognition of Interest  Income and Impairment on Purchased
and Retained  Beneficial  Interests in  Securitized  Financial  Assets,  for the
measurement and recognition of  other-than-temporary  impairment of its debt and
equity securities.

     In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
No. 123 (revised 2004),  Share-Based  Payment ("SFAS 123(R)").  SFAS 123(R) is a
revision  of SFAS  123 and  supersedes  APB 25 and  its  related  implementation
guidance.  SFAS 123(R)  requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee
services  received in exchange for an award of equity  instruments  based on the
grant-date fair value of the award. That cost will be recognized over the period
during  which an employee is  required  to provide  service in exchange  for the
award.  The  grant-date  fair  value  of  employee  share  options  and  similar
instruments  will be  estimated  using  option-pricing  models  adjusted for the
unique  characteristics  of  those  instruments.   SFAS  123(R)  eliminates  the
alternative  to use APB 25's  intrinsic  value  method  of  accounting  that was
provided in SFAS 123 as originally issued. Currently, as discussed in Note 1(e),
Farmer Mac accounts for its stock-based  employee  compensation  plans using the
intrinsic value method of accounting for employee stock options  pursuant to APB
25 and has adopted the  disclosure-only  provisions of SFAS 123. The guidance in
SFAS 123(R) is  effective  for  reporting  periods  beginning  no later than the
beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005.  Farmer Mac is
evaluating the impact of SFAS 123(R) and will adopt it when effective.

Fair value of beneficial interests retained
    in Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities         $ 1,326,837

Weighted-average remaining life (in years)              5.0

Weighted-average prepayment speed (annual rate)         8.7%
    Effect on fair value of a 10% adverse change       $477
    Effect on fair value of a 20% adverse change       $909

Weighted-average discount rate                          5.0%
    Effect on fair value of a 10% adverse change   $(18,154)
    Effect on fair value of a 20% adverse change   $(36,252)
</TABLE>

     These sensitivities are hypothetical.  As the figures indicate,  changes in
fair value based on 10 percent or 20 percent variations in assumptions generally
cannot be extrapolated  because the relationship of the change in assumptions to
the change in fair value may not be linear.  Also, in this table the effect of a
variation in a particular  assumption on the fair value of the retained interest
is calculated  without changing any other  assumption.  In fact,  changes in one
factor  may  result in changes in  another  (for  example,  increases  in market
interest  rates  may  result  in lower  prepayments),  which  might  amplify  or
counteract the sensitivities.

Note 3.  Off-Balance Sheet Guarantees and Long-Term Standby Purchase
         Commitments

Overview

     Farmer Mac offers  approved  agricultural  and rural  residential  mortgage
lenders two  off-balance  sheet  alternatives  to increase  their  liquidity  or
lending  capacity  while  retaining the cash flow  benefits of their loans:  (1)
Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities,  which are available through either the Farmer
Mac I program or the Farmer Mac II program,  and (2) LTSPCs, which are available
only  through  the Farmer Mac I program.  Both of these  alternatives  result in
off-balance sheet transactions for Farmer Mac.


Off-Balance Sheet Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities

     Periodically Farmer Mac transfers  agricultural  mortgage loans into trusts
that are used as vehicles for the  securitization of the transferred  assets and
the beneficial  interests in the trusts are sold to third party  investors.  The
table  below  summarizes  certain  cash  flows  received  from and paid to these
trusts.

Long-Term Standby Purchase Commitments (LTSPCs)

     An LTSPC is a commitment by Farmer Mac to purchase  eligible loans,  either
for cash or in exchange for Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities,  on one or more
undetermined future dates.

     As of March 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, the maximum principal amount of
potential  undiscounted  future  payments  that Farmer Mac could be requested to
make under LTSPCs,  not including  offsets provided by any recourse  provisions,
recoveries from third parties or collateral for the underlying  loans,  was $2.2
billion and $2.3  billion,  respectively.  For all LTSPC  transactions  to date,
Farmer Mac has incurred a charge-off on two loans.

     As of March 31, 2005, the weighted-average  remaining maturity of all loans
underlying  LTSPCs was 14.5 years. For the LTSPCs executed on or before December
31,  2002,  Farmer Mac has recorded an  allowance  for probable  losses on loans
underlying  LTSPCs of $7.7  million as of March 31, 2005 and $7.8  million as of
December 31, 2004.  For those LTSPCs  issued or modified on or after  January 1,
2003,  Farmer Mac has  recorded a liability  for its  obligation  to stand ready
under the commitment in the guarantee and commitment obligation on the condensed
consolidated balance sheet. This liability approximated $9.9 million as of March
31, 2005 and $9.7 million as of December 31, 2004.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and  Results
        of Operations


     Please read the following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition  and Results of  Operations  in  conjunction  with:  (1) the unaudited
condensed  consolidated  financial  statements and the related notes that appear
elsewhere  in this report;  and (2) Farmer Mac's Annual  Report on Form 10-K for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004.

Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

     Certain  statements  made in this report are  "forward-looking  statements"
within  the  meaning of the  Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform Act of 1995
pertaining  to  management's  current  expectations  as to Farmer  Mac's  future
financial results, business prospects and business developments. Forward-looking
statements  include,  without  limitation,   any  statement  that  may  predict,
forecast,  indicate or imply future results,  performance or  achievements,  and
typically are accompanied by, and identified with, such terms as  "anticipates,"
"believes,"  "expects,"  "intends," "should" and similar phrases.  The following
management's  discussion  and  analysis  includes   forward-looking   statements
addressing Farmer Mac's:
          o    prospects for earnings;
          o    prospects for growth in loan purchase, guarantee,  securitization
               and LTSPC volume;
          o    trends in net interest income;
          o    trends in provisions for losses;
          o    trends in expenses;
          o    changes in capital position; and
          o    other business and financial matters.

     Management's  expectations  for Farmer Mac's future  necessarily  involve a
number  of   assumptions   and  estimates  and  the   evaluation  of  risks  and
uncertainties. Various factors could cause Farmer Mac's actual results or events
to differ  materially  from the  expectations  as  expressed  or  implied by the
forward-looking statements, including uncertainties regarding:
          o    the rate and direction of development of the secondary market for
               agricultural mortgage loans;
          o    the possible  establishment of additional statutory or regulatory
               restrictions  or  constraints on Farmer Mac that could hamper its
               growth or diminish its profitability;
          o    increases in general and administrative  expenses attributable to
               growth of the business and the regulatory environment,  including
               the  hiring  of  additional   personnel  with  expertise  in  key
               functional areas;
          o    legislative  or regulatory  developments  or  interpretations  of
               Farmer Mac's statutory charter that could adversely affect Farmer
               Mac,  the  ability  of Farmer  Mac to offer new  products  or the
               ability or motivation of certain  lenders to  participate  in its
               programs or the terms of any such participation,  or increase the
               cost of regulation and related corporate activities;
          o    possible  reaction in the financial  markets to events  involving
               government sponsored enterprises ("GSEs") other than Farmer Mac;
          o    Farmer Mac's  access to the debt  markets at favorable  rates and
               terms;
          o    the possible effect of the risk-based capital requirement,  which
               could, under certain circumstances, be in excess of the statutory
               minimum capital requirement;
          o    the rate of growth in agricultural mortgage indebtedness;
          o    lender  interest in Farmer Mac credit products and the Farmer Mac
               secondary market;
          o    borrower   preferences  for  fixed-rate   agricultural   mortgage
               indebtedness;
          o    competitive  pressures in the purchase of  agricultural  mortgage
               loans and the sale of agricultural mortgage-backed securities and
               debt securities;
          o    substantial changes in interest rates,  agricultural land values,
               commodity prices, export demand for U.S.  agricultural  products,
               the general economy and other factors that may affect delinquency
               levels and credit losses;
          o    protracted adverse weather,  market or other conditions affecting
               particular   geographic   regions  or   particular   agricultural
               commodities or products  related to  agricultural  mortgage loans
               backing Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities or under LTSPCs;
          o    the   willingness   of  investors   to  invest  in   agricultural
               mortgage-backed securities; or
          o    the  effects  on  the  agricultural   economy  or  the  value  of
               agricultural real estate of any changes in federal assistance for
               agriculture.

     The foregoing factors are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report may
include additional factors that could adversely affect Farmer Mac's business and
its financial  performance.  Furthermore,  new risk factors  emerge from time to
time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor
assess the  effects of such  factors on Farmer  Mac's  business or the extent to
which any factor, or combination of factors,  may cause actual results to differ
materially  from the  expectations  expressed or implied by the  forward-looking
statements.  In light of  these  potential  risks  and  uncertainties,  no undue
reliance should be placed on any  forward-looking  statements  expressed in this
report. Furthermore, Farmer Mac undertakes no obligation to release publicly the
results  of  revisions  to any  forward-looking  statements  that may be made to
reflect any future events or circumstances,  except as otherwise mandated by the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

Critical Accounting Policy and Estimates

     The critical  accounting  policy that is both important to the portrayal of
Farmer Mac's financial condition and results of operations and requires complex,
subjective  judgments is the accounting policy for the allowance for losses. For
a discussion of Farmer Mac's critical accounting policy, as well as Farmer Mac's
use of  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect the  amounts  reported  in the
condensed  consolidated  financial  statements and related notes for the periods
presented,  see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results  of  Operations--Critical   Accounting  Policy  and  Estimates"  in  the
Corporation's  Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended  December 31, 2004,
filed with the SEC on March 16, 2005.

Results of Operations

     Overview.  Net income  available to common  stockholders  for first quarter
2005 was $4.9  million  or $0.42 per  diluted  common  share,  compared  to $7.8
million or $0.64 per diluted common share for first quarter 2004.  This decrease
was due  principally  to the  after-tax  effects  of the  $1.7  million  loss on
financial  derivatives  in first  quarter  2005  compared to gains on  financial
derivatives  of $3.2  million in first  quarter  2004,  partially  offset by the
release of $0.7  million  from the  allowance  for losses in first  quarter 2005
compared to provisions for losses of $1.6 million in first quarter 2004.


     As of March 31, 2005, Farmer Mac's 90-day delinquencies (Farmer Mac I loans
purchased or placed under  Farmer Mac I  Guaranteed  Securities  or LTSPCs after
changes to Farmer Mac's statutory charter in 1996 that were 90 days or more past
due, in foreclosure, restructured after delinquency, or in bankruptcy, excluding
loans  performing  under either their  original  loan terms or a  court-approved
bankruptcy plan) were $45.8 million,  representing 1.04 percent of the principal
balance  of all loans  held and loans  underlying  post-1996  Act  Farmer  Mac I
Guaranteed  Securities and LTSPCs,  down from $57.4 million (1.17 percent) as of
March 31, 2004.

     As part of Farmer Mac's continuing evaluation of the overall credit quality
of its portfolio, the strong U.S. agricultural economy, the recent upward trends
in  agricultural  land  values and the  reduction  in Farmer  Mac's  outstanding
guarantees and commitments,  Farmer Mac determined that the appropriate level of
allowance  for losses as of March 31, 2005 was $16.3  million.  This resulted in
the release of approximately $0.7 million from the allowance for losses in first
quarter 2005.  As of March 31, 2005,  the allowance for losses was $16.3 million
and 37 basis points relative to the outstanding Farmer Mac I portfolio, compared
to $17.1  million and 37 basis points as of December 31, 2004 and $22.2  million
and 45 basis points as of March 31, 2004.

      During first quarter 2005, Farmer Mac:

          o    added $33.3 million of Farmer Mac I eligible loans under LTSPCs;
          o    purchased $18.5 million of newly originated Farmer Mac I eligible
               loans; and
          o    purchased $43.6 million of Farmer Mac II eligible USDA-guaranteed
               portions of loans.

As of March 31, 2005, Farmer Mac's outstanding  program volume was $5.3 billion,
which represented approximately 11.1 percent of management's estimate of a $47.8
billion market of eligible  agricultural  mortgage  loans.  Farmer Mac's ongoing
guarantee and commitment fee income reflects the annuity-like  revenue stream of
that  aspect of the  Corporation's  business.  That fee  income is earned on the
cumulative outstanding principal balance of Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities and
loans underlying LTSPCs. Accordingly,  guarantee and commitment fees increase or
decrease through changes in periodic business volume in proportion to the change
in that  cumulative  outstanding  principal  balance,  not in  proportion to the
change in periodic volume.

     To succeed in realizing its business  development and  profitability  goals
over the longer  term,  Farmer Mac must  successfully  market  existing  and new
programs and products to agricultural mortgage lenders.

     Set forth below is a more  detailed  discussion  of Farmer Mac's results of
operations.

     Net Interest Income. Net interest income,  which does not include guarantee
fees for loans purchased prior to April 1, 2001 (the effective date of Statement
of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  140,  Accounting  for  Transfers  and
Servicing of Financial Assets and  Extinguishments of Liabilities ("SFAS 140")),
was $7.8  million for first  quarter  2005,  compared to $9.5  million for first
quarter  2004.  The net interest  yield was 85 basis points for the three months
ended March 31,  2005,  compared to 93 basis  points for the three  months ended
March 31, 2004. The effect of SFAS 140 was the  classification  of approximately
$0.9 million (10 basis  points) of guarantee  fee income as interest  income for
the three  months  ended  March 31,  2005,  compared  to $1.1  million (10 basis
points) for the three months ended March 31, 2004.

     Farmer Mac  classifies  the net  interest  income and  expense  realized on
financial   derivatives   that  are  not  in  fair  value  or  cash  flow  hedge
relationships  as gains and losses on financial  derivatives and trading assets.
For the three months ended March 31, 2005 and 2004, this classification resulted
in the  decrease  of the net  interest  yield of 4 basis  points  in each of the
periods.

     The net interest  yields for the three months ended March 31, 2005 and 2004
included  the benefits of yield  maintenance  payments of 17 basis points and 11
basis points,  respectively.  Yield maintenance  payments  represent the present
value of expected  future interest income streams and accelerate the recognition
of interest  income from the  related  loans.  Because the timing and amounts of
these payments vary greatly,  variations should not be considered  indicative of
positive or negative  trends to gauge future  financial  results.  For the three
months ended March 31, 2005 and 2004, the effects of yield maintenance  payments
on net  income and  diluted  earnings  per share were $1.0  million or $0.08 per
diluted share and $0.8 million or $0.06 per diluted share, respectively.

     The following table provides information regarding  interest-earning assets
and funding  for the  quarters  ended  March 31,  2005 and 2004.  The balance of
non-accruing loans is included in the average balance of interest-earning  loans
presented, though no related income is included in the income figures presented.
Therefore, as the balance of non-accruing loans increases or decreases,  the net
interest yield will increase or decrease  accordingly.  Net interest  income and
the yield will also  fluctuate due to the  uncertainty of the timing and size of
yield  maintenance  payments.  The low  average  rate  earned  on cash  and cash
equivalents  reflects the relatively  low level of short-term  interest rates in
2005 and 2004,  and an increase in short-term  market rates during first quarter
2005.  The  increase in the average  rate for  investments  reflects the general
increase in short-term  rates and the floating  rate nature of most  investments
acquired or reset during first quarter 2005 and outstanding during first quarter
2005.  The higher  average  rate on loans and Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities
during  first  quarter  2005  reflects  the  increase in market rates during the
latter part of 2004 and first  quarter 2005,  which  affected the rates on loans
acquired or reset during that period and outstanding  during first quarter 2005.
The  average  rates on  Farmer  Mac's  notes  payable  due  within  one year are
consistent  with general trends in average  short-term  rates during the periods
presented. The downward trend in the average rate on notes payable due after one
year reflects the retirement of older, higher rate debt, as well as the issuance
of new debt at lower rates during the latter half of 2004 and first quarter 2005
and the relative stability of long-term interest rates during 2005 and 2004.

volume (change in volume  multiplied by old rate) and changes in rate (change in
rate  multiplied  by old  volume).  Combined  rate/volume  variances,  the third
element of the  calculation,  are allocated  based on their  relative  size. The
increases due to rate reflect the  short-term or  adjustable-rate  nature of the
assets or liabilities and the general increases in short term market rates.

</TABLE>

     See "--Regulatory  Matters" for actions by Farmer Mac's federal  regulator,
the Farm Credit  Administration  ("FCA"), that may potentially affect future net
interest income.

     Guarantee and  Commitment  Fees.  Guarantee and  commitment  fees were $5.0
million for first quarter 2005, compared to $5.2 million for first quarter 2004.
The  effects of the  adoption of SFAS 140 were $0.9  million  and $1.1  million,
respectively,  of guarantee fee income being  classified as interest  income for
first  quarter 2005 and first quarter 2004,  although  management  considers the
amount to have been earned in  consideration  for the assumption of credit risk.
That portion of the difference or "spread" between the cost of Farmer Mac's debt
funding  for  loans and the  yield on  post-1996  Act  Farmer  Mac I  Guaranteed
Securities held on its books compensates for credit and interest rate risk. When
a  post-1996  Act Farmer Mac I  Guaranteed  Security  is sold to a third  party,
Farmer Mac  continues  to receive the  guarantee  fee  component of that spread,
which continues to compensate  Farmer Mac for its assumption of credit risk. The
portion  of the  spread  that  compensates  for  interest  rate  risk  would not
typically  continue to be received by Farmer Mac if the asset were sold,  except
to the extent attributable to any retained interest-only strip.

     Expenses.  General and administrative  expenses for first quarter 2005 were
$2.0 million,  compared to $2.1 million for first quarter 2004. Compensation and
employee benefits were $1.8 million in both first quarter 2005 and first quarter
2004. During 2004, and into 2005, Farmer Mac undertook (and expects to continue)
several  initiatives  to validate  and enhance  its risk  management  practices,
internal controls, and accounting and financial reporting. These initiatives are
the  result  of  ongoing   corporate   diligence  and  a  number  of  regulatory
considerations, including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and FCA
requirements,  as well as the heightened focus on the regulatory environment for
GSEs generally.  Regulatory fees assessed by FCA for first quarter 2005 and 2004
were $0.6 million and $0.4 million, respectively.  FCA's regulatory fees charged
to Farmer Mac for the  federal  fiscal year ended  September  30, 2004 were $2.0
million,  and FCA has advised the  Corporation  that its estimated  fees for the
federal  fiscal year ending  September 30, 2005 will be $2.3 million.  After the
end of a federal government fiscal year, FCA may revise its prior year estimated
assessments to reflect  actual costs  incurred,  and has issued both  additional
assessments   and   refunds  in  the  past.   Farmer  Mac  expects  all  of  the
above-mentioned  expenses and  regulatory  fees to continue at or above  current
levels through 2005.

     During  first  quarter  2005,  Farmer Mac  released  $0.7  million from the
allowance  for losses,  compared to provisions of $1.6 million for first quarter
2004.  See  "--Quantitative  and  Qualitative   Disclosures  About  Market  Risk
Management--Credit  Risk" for  additional  information  regarding  Farmer  Mac's
provision for losses and provision for loan losses. As of March 31, 2005, Farmer
Mac's total  allowance  for losses  totaled  $16.3  million,  or 0.37 percent of
outstanding loans held or loans underlying post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed
Securities and LTSPCs, compared to $17.1 million and 0.37 percent as of December
31, 2004.

     Gains and Losses on Financial  Derivatives  and Trading  Assets.  For first
quarter  2005,  the loss on financial  derivatives  and trading  assets was $1.7
million,  compared to a gain of $3.2 million for first quarter 2004. The loss in
first quarter 2005 and the gain in first quarter 2004  resulted  primarily  from
fluctuations  in the  fair  values  of  financial  derivatives,  resulting  from
movements  in  interest  rates,  that were not  designated  as either fair value
hedges or cash flow hedges in accordance with SFAS 133.

     Non-GAAP Performance Measures.  Farmer Mac reports its financial results in
accordance with GAAP. In addition to GAAP measures,  Farmer Mac presents certain
non-GAAP  performance  measures.  Farmer  Mac uses  these  non-GAAP  performance
measures to develop financial plans, to measure corporate economic  performance,
and to set incentive  compensation  because,  in management's view, the non-GAAP
measures  provide a more  meaningful  representation  of Farmer  Mac's  economic
performance,  transaction  economics  and  business  trends.  Investors  and the
investment  analyst  community have previously  relied upon similar  measures to
evaluate  performance  and issue  projections.  These non-GAAP  disclosures  are
intended to supplement, not replace, GAAP information.

     Farmer Mac developed  non-GAAP core earnings to present net income less the
after-tax  effects of SFAS 133.  Core  earnings for the three months ended March
31, 2005 were $6.3 million,  compared to $5.9 million for the three months ended
March 31,  2004.  The  reconciliation  of GAAP net  income  available  to common
stockholders to core earnings is presented in the following table:

     Business  Volume.  New  business  volume for first  quarter  2005 was $95.5
million,  down $111.7  million from the same period in 2004.  Presently,  Farmer
Mac's new business with agricultural mortgage lenders has been slowed by:

          o    reduced growth rates in the  agricultural  mortgage  market,  due
               largely to the increased liquidity of agricultural borrowers;
          o    increased   available   capital  and  liquidity  of  agricultural
               lenders;
          o    new  alternative  sources of funding and credit  enhancement  for
               agricultural lenders;
          o    increased  competition  in the secondary  market for purchases of
               quality agricultural mortgage loans;
          o    adverse  publicity  about and  increased  regulatory  pressure on
               GSEs; and
          o    uncertainty  created by the  proposed FCA  regulation  concerning
               risk-weighting  of  assets  held by FCS  institutions  which,  if
               adopted in its current form,  could  decrease the value of LTSPCs
               and Farmer  Mac swaps to those  institutions  (See  "--Regulatory
               Matters").

     For a more detailed discussion of the above factors and the related effects
on Farmer Mac's business volume,  see  "Management's  Discussion and Analysis of
Financial  Condition  and  Results  of  Operations--Outlook  for  2005"  in  the
Corporation's  Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended  December 31, 2004,
filed with the SEC on March 16, 2005.

     Looking  ahead,  Farmer  Mac is  developing  innovative  ways to serve  the
financing needs of rural America,  and remains  confident of  opportunities  for
growth and increased business volume as a result of the Corporation's  marketing
efforts.

     The  decreases  in  defaulted   loans  purchased  and  in  defaulted  loans
transferred to loans reflect a reduction in newly  delinquent  loans  underlying
Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs.

     The  weighted-average  age of the Farmer Mac I newly originated and current
seasoned  loans  purchased  during first quarter 2005 and first quarter 2004 was
less than one month. Of the Farmer Mac I newly  originated and current  seasoned
loans purchased during first quarter 2005 and first quarter 2004, 54 percent and
70 percent,  respectively,  had principal  amortization  periods longer than the
maturity   date,   resulting   in  balloon   payments   at   maturity,   with  a
weighted-average  remaining  term to  maturity  of 15.3  years  and 15.2  years,
respectively.  The  weighted-average  age of delinquent  loans  purchased out of
securitized  pools and LTSPCs  during first  quarter 2005 and first quarter 2004
was 6.7 years.

     More than 250  lenders  were  actively  participating  either  directly  or
indirectly  in one or both of the Farmer Mac I or Farmer Mac II  programs  as of
March 31, 2005, with loans to approximately 20,000 borrowers.

     As of March 31, 2005,  there were 160  approved  loan sellers in the Farmer
Mac I program ranging from single-office to multi-branch institutions,  spanning
community banks,  Farm Credit System  associations,  mortgage  companies,  large
multi-state Farm Credit System banks,  commercial banks and insurance companies.
During  2004,  there were 59 approved  loan  sellers  active in the Farmer Mac I
program. In addition to participating directly in the Farmer Mac I program, some
of the approved loan sellers enable other lenders to  participate  indirectly in
the Farmer Mac I program by  managing  correspondent  networks  of lenders  from
which  they  purchase  loans  to sell to  Farmer  Mac.  As of  March  31,  2005,
approximately 75 lenders were participating in those networks.

     Any lender  authorized by the USDA to obtain a USDA guarantee on a loan may
be a seller in the Farmer Mac II program.  As of March 31, 2005,  there were 125
active sellers in the Farmer Mac II program,  compared to 133 as of December 31,
2004.  Sellers  in the Farmer Mac II program  consist  mostly of  community  and
regional banks.

      As of March 31, 2005, outstanding commitments to purchase Farmer Mac I
loans totaled $3.5 million, compared to $2.3 million as of March 31, 2004. All
Farmer Mac I commitments outstanding as of March 31, 2005 and 2004 were
mandatory commitments. Loans submitted for approval or approved but not yet
committed to purchase totaled $20.4 million as of March 31, 2005, compared to
$25.4 million as of March 31, 2004. Not all of these loans will be purchased, as
some will ultimately be denied for credit reasons or withdrawn by the seller.

     USDA's most recent  publications  (as available on USDA's website as of May
6, 2005) forecast:

          o    2005 net cash farm income to be $78.1 billion,  exceeding the two
               successive  record  years of  $77.8  billion  in 2004  and  $68.6
               billion in 2003;
          o    2005 net farm income to be $64.4 billion,  which is a decrease of
               $9.2 billion from the record $73.6 billion estimated for 2004 but
               still $13.3  million  higher  than the  10-year  average net farm
               income;
          o    Total direct government  payments to be $24.1 billion in 2005, an
               increase from the 2004 estimate of $14.5  billion.  Market prices
               for crops affect direct  government  payment rates for government
               programs;  USDA  anticipates  program  crop prices to be lower in
               2005, due to large inventories from 2003 and 2004 bumper crops;
          o    The value of U.S.  farm real  estate to  increase  4.5 percent in
               2005 to $1.23  trillion,  a smaller  increase  as compared to the
               2004 increase of 5.4 percent. USDA is anticipating improvement in
               the general economy to support further growth in farmland values,
               though at a rate  slower  than the  average  annual  gain of 5.85
               percent since 1999; and
          o    The amount of farm real estate debt to increase by 5.2 percent in
               2005 to $119.5 billion, up from $113.6 billion in 2004.


     The USDA forecast  components  referenced above relate to U.S.  agriculture
generally, but should be favorable for Farmer Mac's financial condition relative
to its exposure to  outstanding  guarantees  and  commitments,  as they indicate
strong  borrower cash flows,  and generally  increased  values in U.S. farm real
estate.

Balance Sheet Review

     During the three months ended March 31, 2005,  there were $72.1  million of
net principal  paydowns in program assets (Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities and
loans) and a $67.6 million  increase in the  portfolio of investment  securities
and cash and cash equivalents. Consistent with the net decrease in assets during
the period,  total liabilities  decreased $6.1 million from December 31, 2004 to
March 31, 2005.  For further  information  regarding  off-balance  sheet program
activities, see "--Off-Balance Sheet Program Activities" below.

     During  the  three  months  ended  March  31,   2005,   accumulated   other
comprehensive income/(loss) increased $1.6 million, which is the net effect of a
$10.6 million decrease in after-tax unrealized gains on securities available for
sale and a $12.2  million  increase  in the  after-tax  fair value of  financial
derivatives  classified  as cash flow hedges.  Accumulated  other  comprehensive
income/(loss)  is not a component  of Farmer  Mac's core  capital or  regulatory
capital.

     As of March 31, 2005,  Farmer Mac's core capital  totaled  $235.6  million,
compared to $237.7  million as of December 31, 2004. As of March 31, 2005,  core
capital  exceeded Farmer Mac's statutory  minimum capital  requirement of $127.9
million by $107.7 million.

     Farmer Mac was in compliance  with its risk-based  capital  standards as of
March 31,  2005.  As of March 31,  2005,  the  risk-based  capital  stress  test
generated a  regulatory  capital  requirement  of $59.3  million.  Farmer  Mac's
regulatory  capital of $251.9  million as of March 31, 2005 exceeded that amount
by  approximately  $192.6  million.  The  increase  in  the  risk-based  capital
requirement  from  December  31, 2004  ($37.1  million) to March 31, 2005 ($59.3
million) was a result of changes in the interest rate environment. Farmer Mac is
required  to  hold  capital  at the  higher  of the  statutory  minimum  capital
requirement or the amount required by the risk-based capital stress test.

Off-Balance Sheet Program Activities

     Farmer Mac offers  approved  agricultural  and rural  residential  mortgage
lenders two  off-balance  sheet  alternatives  to increase  their  liquidity  or
lending  capacity  while  retaining the cash flow  benefits of their loans:  (1)
Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities,  which are available through either the Farmer
Mac I program or the Farmer Mac II program,  and (2) LTSPCs, which are available
only  through  the Farmer Mac I program.  Both of these  alternatives  result in
off-balance  sheet  transactions  for Farmer  Mac.  See Note 3 to the  condensed
consolidated financial statements for further information regarding Farmer Mac's
off-balance sheet program activities.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Management

     Interest  Rate Risk.  Farmer Mac is  subject to  interest  rate risk on all
assets held for investment  because of possible  timing  differences in the cash
flows of the assets and related  liabilities.  This risk is primarily related to
loans held and on-balance sheet Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities because of the
ability of borrowers to prepay their mortgages before the scheduled  maturities,
thereby  increasing the risk of asset and liability cash flow  mismatches.  Cash
flow mismatches in a changing  interest rate environment can reduce the earnings
of the  Corporation  if assets repay sooner than expected and the resulting cash
flows must be reinvested in lower-yielding investments when Farmer Mac's funding
costs  cannot be  correspondingly  reduced,  or if assets repay more slowly than
expected and the associated debt must be replaced by higher-cost debt.

     Yield maintenance  provisions and other prepayment  penalties  contained in
many agricultural  mortgage loans reduce, but do not eliminate,  this prepayment
risk,  particularly in the case of a defaulted loan where yield  maintenance may
not be  collected.  Those  provisions  require  borrowers to make an  additional
payment when they prepay their loans so that,  when  reinvested with the prepaid
principal, yield maintenance payments generate substantially the same cash flows
that would have been generated had the loan not prepaid. Those provisions create
a disincentive  to prepayment and  compensate the  Corporation  for its interest
rate  risks  to a  large  degree.  As of  March  31,  2005,  57  percent  of the
outstanding  balance of all loans  held and loans  underlying  on-balance  sheet
Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities (including 80 percent of all loans with fixed
interest  rates)  were  covered  by  yield  maintenance   provisions  and  other
prepayment  penalties.  Of the Farmer Mac I new and current  loans  purchased in
first  quarter  2005,  one  percent  had yield  maintenance  or another  form of
prepayment  protection.  As of  March  31,  2005,  none  of the  USDA-guaranteed
portions  underlying  Farmer Mac II Guaranteed  Securities had yield maintenance
provisions;  however,  14.7  percent  contained  prepayment  penalties.  Of  the
USDA-guaranteed portions purchased in first quarter 2005, 44.0 percent contained
prepayment penalties.

     As of March  31,  2005,  Farmer  Mac had  $424.0  million  of cash and cash
equivalents  and $1.1 billion of investment  securities.  Cash  equivalents  and
investment securities pose only limited interest rate risk to Farmer Mac, due to
their closely matched funding. Farmer Mac's cash equivalents mature within three
months and are match-funded with discount notes having similar maturities. As of
March 31, 2005, Farmer Mac's investment  securities  consisted of $882.3 million
(78.1  percent) of floating rate  securities  that have rates that adjust within
one year. These floating rate investments are funded using:

          o    a series of  discount  note  issuances  in which each  successive
               discount note is issued and matures on or about the corresponding
               interest rate reset date of the related investment;
          o    floating-rate  notes having similar rate reset  provisions as the
               related investment; or
          o    fixed-rate  notes swapped to floating  rates having similar reset
               provisions as the related investment.

     The most  comprehensive  stress test of Farmer Mac's  exposure to long-term
interest rate risk is the  sensitivity  of its Market Value of Equity ("MVE") to
yield curve shocks.  MVE  represents  the present value of all future cash flows
from on- and off-balance  sheet assets,  liabilities and financial  derivatives,
discounted  at  current  interest  rates and  spreads.  The  following  schedule
summarizes the results of Farmer Mac's MVE sensitivity  analysis as of March 31,
2005 and December 31, 2004 to an immediate and  instantaneous  parallel shift in
the yield curve.

</FN>
</TABLE>

     During first quarter 2005,  Farmer Mac maintained a relatively low level of
interest  rate  sensitivity  through  ongoing  asset  and  liability  management
activities.  As of March 31, 2005, a uniform or "parallel" increase of 100 basis
points would have increased  NII, a shorter-term  measure of interest rate risk,
by 2.4  percent,  while a  parallel  decrease  of 100 basis  points  would  have
decreased NII by 0.5 percent.  Farmer Mac also measures the  sensitivity of both
MVE and  NII to a  variety  of  non-parallel  interest  rate  shocks,  including
flattening and steepening yield curve scenarios.  As of March 31, 2005, both MVE
and NII showed similar or lesser  sensitivity to  non-parallel  shocks as to the
parallel  shocks.  As of March 31, 2005,  Farmer Mac's  effective  duration gap,
another  standard  measure of interest rate risk that measures the expected life
of assets compared to that of liabilities, was plus 1.8 months, compared to plus
0.4 months as of December  31,  2004.  Duration  matching  helps to maintain the
correlation of cash flows and stable portfolio earnings even when interest rates
are not stable.  The relative  insensitivity of Farmer Mac's MVE and NII to both
parallel and non-parallel  interest rate shocks,  and its duration gap, indicate
the  effectiveness of the  Corporation's  approach to managing its interest rate
risk exposures.


     As of March 31, 2005,  Farmer Mac had $1.4 billion combined notional amount
of interest rate swaps with terms ranging from 1 to 15 years.  Of those interest
rate swaps,  $650.5  million were  floating-to-fixed  rate  interest rate swaps,
$205.0  million were  fixed-to-floating  interest rate swaps and $583.3  million
were basis swaps.

     Farmer Mac uses financial  derivatives as an end-user for hedging purposes,
not for trading or speculative  purposes.  When financial  derivatives  meet the
specific  hedge  criteria  under SFAS 133, they are accounted for as either fair
value  hedges or cash flow  hedges.  Financial  derivatives  that do not satisfy
those hedge  criteria  are not  accounted  for as hedges and changes in the fair
value of those financial derivatives are reported as a gain or loss on financial
derivatives and trading assets in the consolidated statements of operations. All
of Farmer Mac's financial  derivative  transactions are conducted under standard
collateralized  agreements that limit Farmer Mac's potential  credit exposure to
any counterparty.  As of March 31, 2005 Farmer Mac had no  uncollateralized  net
exposure to any counterparty.

     Credit Risk.  Farmer Mac's  primary  exposure to credit risk is the risk of
loss  resulting  from the  inability of  borrowers  to repay their  mortgages in
conjunction  with a deficiency  in the value of the  collateral  relative to the
amount outstanding on the mortgage and the costs of liquidation.  Farmer Mac has
established underwriting, appraisal and documentation standards for agricultural
mortgage  loans to  mitigate  the risk of loss  from  borrower  defaults  and to
provide  guidance  concerning  the  management,  administration  and  conduct of
underwriting and appraisals to all  participating  sellers and potential sellers
in its programs.

     Farmer Mac's  allowance  for losses is presented in four  components on its
consolidated balance sheet:

          o    an "Allowance for loan losses" on loans held for investment;
          o    a valuation  allowance on real estate owned, which is included in
               the balance  sheet under "Real  estate  owned,  net of  valuation
               allowance";
          o    a "Contingent obligation for probable losses" on loans underlying
               post-1996  Act  Farmer  Mac I  Guaranteed  Securities  and LTSPCs
               entered  into or  modified  after  January  1,  2003,  for  which
               inherent   losses  existed  at  the  time  of  the  guarantee  or
               commitment and could be reasonably estimated,  is included in the
               balance  sheet as a portion of the amount  reported as "Guarantee
               and commitment obligation"; and
          o    an allowance for losses on loans underlying  post-1996 Act Farmer
               Mac I Guaranteed  Securities and LTSPCs, which is included in the
               balance sheet under "Reserve for losses."

     Farmer Mac's  provision  for losses is presented in two  components  on its
consolidated statement of operations:

          o    a "Provision for loan losses," which represents  losses on Farmer
               Mac's loans held for investment; and
          o    a  "Provision  for  losses,"  which  represents  losses  on loans
               underlying  post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities and
               LTSPCs and real estate owned.

     Farmer Mac estimates probable losses using a systematic process that begins
with  management's  evaluation  of the  results  of its  proprietary  loan  pool
simulation  and  guarantee  fee  model  (the  "Model").  The  Model  draws  upon
historical  information from a data set of agricultural  mortgage loans recorded
over a longer period of time than Farmer Mac's own experience to date,  screened
to include  only those  loans with  credit  characteristics  similar to those on
which Farmer Mac has assumed credit risk. The results generated by the Model are
modified by the  application of management's  judgment,  as required to take key
factors into account, including:

          o    economic conditions;
          o    geographic and agricultural  commodity/product  concentrations in
               Farmer Mac's portfolio;
          o    the credit profile of Farmer Mac's portfolio;
          o    delinquency trends of Farmer Mac's portfolio;
          o    Farmer Mac's experience in the management and sale of real estate
               owned; and
          o    historical  charge-off  and recovery  activities  of Farmer Mac's
               portfolio.

     Management  believes that the general  allowance,  which is the  difference
between the total allowance for losses (generated  through use of the Model) and
the specific  allowances,  adequately covers any probable losses inherent in the
portfolio of performing loans under Statement of Financial  Accounting Standards
No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies ("SFAS 5").

Mac's allowance for losses for the three months ended March 31, 2005 and 2004:

     During  first  quarter  2005,  Farmer Mac  released  $0.7  million from the
allowance  for losses,  compared to provisions of $1.6 million for first quarter
2004.  During  first  quarter  2005,  Farmer Mac charged off  $130,000 in losses
against  the  allowance  for  losses  and  had  $45,000  in  recoveries  for net
charge-offs of $85,000.  During first quarter 2004,  Farmer Mac charged off $1.5
million  in  losses  against  the  allowance  for  losses  and  had  $37,000  in
recoveries.  There was no previously  accrued or advanced  interest on loans and
Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities  that were charged off in first quarter 2005
and 2004.  During first  quarter  2005,  Farmer Mac received $0.1 million from a
seller for breaches of  representations  and  warranties  associated  with prior
sales of agricultural  mortgage loans to Farmer Mac, which amount Farmer Mac had
previously  charged off as losses on the  associated  loan.  This  recovery  was
reported as income and is not  reflected  in the net  charge-offs  for the three
months ended March 31, 2005 presented above. As of March 31, 2005,  Farmer Mac's
allowance  for  losses  totaled  $16.3  million,  or  37  basis  points  of  the
outstanding  principal balance of loans held and loans underlying  post-1996 Act
Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities  and LTSPCs,  compared to $17.1  million (37
basis points) as of December 31, 2004.

     As of March 31,  2005,  Farmer  Mac's 90-day  delinquencies  totaled  $45.8
million and represented 1.04 percent of the principal  balance of all loans held
and loans  underlying  post-1996  Act Farmer  Mac I  Guaranteed  Securities  and
LTSPCs,  compared to $57.4  million  (1.17  percent) as of March 31, 2004. As of
March 31, 2005,  Farmer  Mac's  non-performing  assets  (which  includes  90-day
delinquencies,  loans  performing  under either their  original  loan terms or a
court-approved bankruptcy plan, and real estate owned) totaled $70.3 million and
represented  1.59 percent of the  principal  balance of all loans held and loans
underlying post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs, compared
to $91.3  million  (1.86  percent)  as of March 31,  2004.  Loans that have been
restructured  after  delinquency were  insignificant and are included within the
reported 90-day delinquency and non-performing  asset disclosures.  From quarter
to quarter,  Farmer Mac anticipates that 90-day delinquencies and non-performing
assets will  fluctuate,  both in dollars and as a percentage of the  outstanding
portfolio,  with higher levels likely at the end of the first and third quarters
of each year corresponding to the semi-annual (January 1st and July 1st) payment
characteristics of most Farmer Mac I loans.

     The following table presents historical  information regarding Farmer Mac's
non-performing assets and 90-day delinquencies:

     As of March 31, 2005,  approximately  $1.3 billion (29.8 percent) of Farmer
Mac's  outstanding  loans held and loans  underlying  post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I
Guaranteed  Securities  and LTSPCs  were in their peak  delinquency  and default
years  (approximately  years three through five after origination),  compared to
$1.6 billion (32.9  percent) of such loans as of March 31, 2004. The Model takes
the portfolio age distribution and maturation into  consideration.  Accordingly,
those trends did not cause  management to alter the Model's  projection  for the
provisions for losses.

     As of March 31, 2005,  Farmer Mac analyzed  $94.1 million of its assets for
collateral shortfalls against updated appraised values, other updated collateral
valuations or discounted values. Of the $94.1 million of assets analyzed,  $81.7
million were  adequately  collateralized.  For the $12.4  million of assets that
were not adequately  collateralized,  individual  collateral  shortfalls totaled
$0.9  million.  Accordingly,  Farmer Mac allocated  specific  allowances of $0.9
million to those  under-collateralized  assets as of March 31, 2005. As of March
31, 2005,  after the allocation of specific  allowances to  under-collateralized
loans,  Farmer Mac had additional  non-specific  or general  allowances of $15.4
million, bringing the total allowance for losses to $16.3 million.

     As of March 31, 2005, the weighted-average  original  loan-to-value ("LTV")
ratio for all  loans  held and  loans  underlying  post-1996  Act  Farmer  Mac I
Guaranteed  Securities  and  LTSPCs  was 50  percent,  and the  weighted-average
original LTV ratio for all post-1996 Act non-performing assets was 55 percent.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

     Farmer Mac has  sufficient  liquidity and capital  resources to support its
operations  for the next twelve  months and has a  contingency  funding  plan to
handle unanticipated disruptions in its access to the capital markets.

     Debt Issuance.  Section 8.6(e) of Farmer Mac's statutory charter (12 U.S.C.
ss.  2279aa-6(e))  authorizes  Farmer Mac to issue debt  obligations to purchase
eligible  mortgage  loans and Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities and to maintain
reasonable amounts for business operations, including adequate liquidity. Farmer
Mac funds its  program  operations  primarily  by issuing  debt  obligations  of
various maturities in the public capital markets.  Farmer Mac's debt obligations
consist of discount notes and medium-term notes,  including floating rate notes,
issued to obtain funds  principally to cover the costs of purchasing and holding
loans and securities  (including Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities).  Farmer Mac
also issues discount notes and medium-term  notes to obtain funds to finance its
investments, transaction costs, guarantee payments and LTSPC payments.

     The interest and  principal on Farmer Mac's debt are not  guaranteed by and
do not constitute debts or obligations of FCA or the United States or any agency
or  instrumentality of the United States other than Farmer Mac. Farmer Mac is an
institution  of the  Farm  Credit  System,  but is not  liable  for any  debt or
obligation of any other institution of the Farm Credit System. Likewise, neither
the Farm Credit System nor any other  individual  institution of the Farm Credit
System  is  liable  for any debt or  obligation  of  Farmer  Mac.  Income to the
purchaser of a Farmer Mac discount note or medium-term  note is not exempt under
federal law from federal,  state or local taxation.  The Corporation's  discount
notes and medium-term  notes are not currently rated by a nationally  recognized
statistical rating organization (NRSRO). (See "--Regulatory Matters" below.)

     Farmer Mac's board of directors has  authorized  the issuance of up to $5.0
billion of  discount  notes and  medium-term  notes (of which $3.5  billion  was
outstanding as of March 31, 2005), subject to periodic review of the adequacy of
that level relative to Farmer Mac's borrowing  requirements.  Farmer Mac invests
the proceeds of such issuances in loans,  Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities and
non-program  investment assets in accordance with guidelines  established by its
board of directors.

     Liquidity.  The  funding  and  liquidity  needs of  Farmer  Mac's  business
programs are driven by the purchase and  retention of eligible  loans and Farmer
Mac  Guaranteed  Securities,  the  maturities of Farmer Mac's discount notes and
medium-term notes and payment of principal and interest on Farmer Mac Guaranteed
Securities. Farmer Mac's primary sources of funds to meet these needs are:

          o    principal  and  interest   payments  and  ongoing  guarantee  and
               commitment   fees  received  on  loans,   Farmer  Mac  Guaranteed
               Securities and LTSPCs;
          o    principal  and  interest   payments   received  from   investment
               securities; and
          o    the issuance of new discount notes and medium-term notes.

     As a result  of  Farmer  Mac's  regular  issuance  of  discount  notes  and
medium-term notes and its status as a federally chartered instrumentality of the
United  States,  Farmer  Mac has been  able to access  the  capital  markets  at
favorable rates. Farmer Mac has also used floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps,
combined with discount note issuances,  as a source of fixed-rate funding. While
the swap market may provide  favorable  fixed rates,  swap  transactions  expose
Farmer Mac to the risk of future  widening of its own  issuance  spreads  versus
corresponding  LIBOR rates. If the spreads on the Farmer Mac discount notes were
to  increase  relative to LIBOR,  Farmer Mac would be exposed to a  commensurate
reduction   on  its  net  interest   yield  on  the   notional   amount  of  its
floating-to-fixed  interest  rate  swaps and  other  LIBOR-based  floating  rate
assets.  Farmer Mac  compensates for this risk by pricing the required net yield
on program  asset  purchases to reflect the cost of  medium-term  notes  without
regard to the savings that may be achievable in the interest rate swap market.

     Farmer Mac  maintains a  liquidity  investment  portfolio  of cash and cash
equivalents  (including  commercial  paper and  other  short-term  money  market
instruments)  and  investment  securities  consisting  mostly of  floating  rate
securities  with rates that adjust within one year,  which can be drawn upon for
liquidity  needs. As of March 31, 2005,  Farmer Mac's cash and cash  equivalents
and investment securities were $424.0 million and $1.1 billion, respectively. In
addition,  as of March 31, 2005,  Farmer Mac held a $728.4 million  portfolio of
Farmer Mac II  Guaranteed  Securities  backed by  USDA-guaranteed  portions that
carry the full faith and credit of the U.S.  Government.  As of March 31,  2005,
the  aggregate  of the Farmer Mac II  Guaranteed  Securities  and the  liquidity
investment portfolio  represented 62.5 percent of total liabilities.  Farmer Mac
has a policy of maintaining a minimum of 60 days of liquidity and a target of 90
days of liquidity.  For first quarter 2005,  Farmer Mac maintained an average of
greater than 90 days of liquidity.

     Capital.  During first quarter 2005, Farmer Mac repurchased  291,454 shares
of its Class C Non-Voting Common Stock, at an average price of $20.35 per share,
pursuant to the  Corporation's  previously  announced stock repurchase  program.
These  repurchases  reduced  the  Corporation's  capital by  approximately  $5.9
million.

Regulatory Matters

     Regulatory  actions continue to affect Farmer Mac's business outlook.  Both
FCA  and  the  Farm  Credit  System  Insurance  Corporation  ("FCSIC"),  a  U.S.
Government  controlled  corporation managed by a three-member board of directors
composed of the members of the FCA Board, have cautioned FCS institutions  about
doing business with GSEs,  including  Farmer Mac, and FCSIC has raised technical
objections  to FCS  institutions'  use  of  Farmer  Mac  Farmer  Mac  Guaranteed
Securities swaps.

     During second quarter 2004, FCA published a proposed regulation relating to
Farmer Mac's investments and liquidity.  Farmer Mac expects to be able to comply
with the  regulation  if it is  adopted in its  current  form,  though  analysis
indicates it could limit future increases in Farmer Mac's non-program investment
portfolio and the related net interest  income.  The Corporation  disagrees with
certain  aspects  of the  proposed  regulation  and  submitted  comments  on the
proposal to FCA accordingly.

     On August 6, 2004, FCA published a proposed  regulation that, if adopted as
proposed,  could  adversely  affect Farmer Mac's business by  establishing a new
risk-weight allocation of capital applicable to Farmer Mac transactions with FCS
institutions,  which comprise a major segment of Farmer Mac's customer base. The
proposed  regulation  would require FCS  institutions  to risk-weight  assets on
their books that are guaranteed by a GSE based on the financial  strength rating
of the GSE, as determined by an NRSRO. Under the proposed regulation: (a) the 20
percent  risk-weight  would apply to such assets only if the GSE guarantor had a
AAA or AA rating  from an NRSRO;  (b) an A rating  would  result in a 50 percent
risk-weight; and (c) a lower rating (or no rating) would result in a 100 percent
risk-weight.  Farmer Mac is currently unrated. Currently, all banking regulators
and FCA accord a 20 percent  risk-weight  to assets backed by guarantees of GSEs
such as Fannie Mae,  Freddie  Mac or Farmer Mac.  The  proposed  regulation  was
subject  to a 90-day  public  comment  period  and,  as  drafted,  would have an
effective date eighteen months after the final regulation is published.

     If the proposed  regulation  is adopted as a final rule in its current form
and  Farmer  Mac does not  receive  a rating of at least AA  within  the  period
provided  for in the proposed  regulation,  not only would the benefit to an FCS
institution of doing  business with Farmer Mac be diminished  after the adoption
of the regulation, but also, based on the language of the proposed regulation, a
significant  portion of the current  $2.8  billion of  outstanding  Farmer Mac I
guarantees and  commitments  currently in place with FCS  institutions  might be
subject to early termination. There can be no assurance that the regulation will
not be adopted as a final rule in its  current  form or in a modified  form with
substantially the same effect. Likewise,  Farmer Mac currently is not rated, and
there can be no assurance  that Farmer Mac would receive a AAA or AA rating from
an NRSRO.  As set forth in prior  disclosures,  Farmer  Mac  disagrees  with the
proposed  regulation  as it would affect the  Corporation,  and has  submitted a
comment letter to FCA setting forth its position.

Other Matters

     In fourth quarter 2004 and first quarter 2005,  Farmer Mac paid a quarterly
dividend of $0.10 per share on the Corporation's three classes of common stock -
Class A Voting Common Stock, Class B Voting Common Stock, and Class C Non-Voting
Common Stock.  Each dividend was paid on the last day of each quarter to holders
of record as of the 15th day of the month in which the dividend was paid. Farmer
Mac expects to continue  to pay  comparable  quarterly  cash  dividends  for the
foreseeable  future,  subject to the outlook and indicated  capital needs of the
Corporation  and the  determination  of the  board of  directors.  Farmer  Mac's
ability to declare and pay  dividends  could be restricted if it were to fail to
comply  with  regulatory   capital   requirements.   See   "Business--Government
Regulation of Farmer Mac--Regulation--Capital  Standards--Enforcement levels" in
Farmer Mac's Annual  Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended  December 31,
2004.  Farmer Mac's ability to pay dividends on its common stock is also subject
to the payment of dividends on its outstanding preferred stock.

disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information  required
to be disclosed  in the  Corporation's  periodic  filings  under the  Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"),  including this report,  is recorded,
processed,  summarized and reported on a timely basis. These disclosure controls
and  procedures  include  controls  and  procedures   designed  to  ensure  that
information  required to be disclosed  under the Exchange Act is accumulated and
communicated  to  the  Corporation's  management  on a  timely  basis  to  allow
decisions  regarding required  disclosure.  Farmer Mac's Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial  Officer have evaluated the  effectiveness of the design and
operation of the  Corporation's  disclosure  controls and procedures (as defined
under Rules  13a-15(e)  and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of March 31, 2005.
Based upon that  evaluation,  Farmer  Mac's  Chief  Executive  Officer and Chief
Financial Officer have concluded that the Corporation's  disclosure controls and
procedures are adequate and effective.

     Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. There were no changes
in Farmer Mac's  internal  control over financial  reporting  during the quarter
ended March 31, 2005 that have materially affected,  or are reasonably likely to
